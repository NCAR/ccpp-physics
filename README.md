# NEMSfv3gfs
This is a development branch of the VLAB repository maintained by EMC.

The branch "gmtb/ccpp" will be used by GMTB developers to integrate the CCPP interfaces and physics into NEMSfv3gfs. This branch will be regularly updated with master-commits from VLAB, and also regularly pushed to VLAB for code review.
