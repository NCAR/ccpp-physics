\section des_rrtmg Description
 Radiative processes are among the most complex and
 computationally intensive parts of all model physics. As an
 essential component of modeling the atmosphere, radiation directly
 and indirectly connects all physics processes with model dynamics,
 and it regulates the overall earth-atmosphere energy exchanges and
 transformations.

 The schematic radiation module structure is shown in Figure 1.

 GFS radiation package is intended to provide a fast and accurate
 method of determining the total radiative flux at any given
 location. These calculations provide both the total radiative flux
 at the ground surface, which is needed to establish the surface
 energy budget, and the vertical radiative net flux divergence, which is
 used to calculate the radiative heating and cooling rates of a given
 atmospheric layer. The magnitude of the terms in the surface energy
 budget can set the stage for moist deep convection and are crucial
 to the formation of low-level clouds. In addition, the vertical
 radiative flux divergence can produce substantial cooling,
 particularly at the tops of clouds, which can have strong dynamical
 effects on cloud evolution.
 
 Since 2007, the longwave (LW) and the shortwave (SW) radiation
 parameterizations in NCEP's operational GFS are both modified and
 optimized versions of the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for GCMs
 (RRTMG_LW and RRTMG_SW, respectively) developed at AER \a inc.
 (Atmospheric and Environmental Research)
 (Iacono et al.(2008) \cite iacono_et_al_2008; Mlawer et al.(1997) \cite mlawer_et_al_1997; 
  Iacono et al.(2000) \cite iacono_et_al_2000; Clough et al. 2005 \cite clough_et_al_2005). The LW algorithm
 contains 140 unevenly distributed g-points (quadrature points) in 16
 broad spectral bands, while the SW algorithm includes 112 g-points
 in 14 bands. In addition to the major atmospheric absorbing gases of
 ozone, water vapor, and carbon dioxide, the algorithm also includes
 various minor absorbing species such as methane, nitrous oxide,
 oxygen, and in the longwave up to four types of halocarbons (CFCs).
 To represent statistically the unresolved subgrid cloud variability
 when dealing multi layered clouds, a Monte-Carlo Independent Column
 Approximation (\b McICA) method is used in the RRTMG radiative transfer.
 Several cloud overlap methods, including maximum-random, exponential,
 and exponential-random are available in both LW and SW
 radiation calculations.

 - CSULFtoa: Upward LW
 - CSUSFtoa: Upward SW


In 2022, requests have been made by many physics developers and users to rewrite
the cloud routines (routines progcld) for radiation computation in the program
radiation_clouds.f. Those cloud subroutines are very similar, and
have many lines of common code. We modified the radiation_clouds.f module,
and includes all the calculations of the cloud properties to a new subroutine
radiation_clouds_prop. We also moved the common code from subroutines
progcld to this new subroutine. Subroutine radiation_clouds_prop can be
called by RRTMG and RRTMGP. A single call to the subroutine
radiation_clouds_prop can connect to the calculations of the cloud
radiation properties for all the microphysics schemes.

Summary of the major changes:
- \ref radiation_clouds.f : A new subroutine module_radiation_clouds::radiation_clouds_prop was added to radiation_clouds.f. This new subroutine calculates all cloud radiation properties for all the microphysics schemes. 

 -    module_radiation_clouds::progcld_zhao_carr()
 -    module_radiation_clouds::progcld_zhao_carr_pdf()
 -    module_radiation_clouds::progcld_gfdl_lin()
 -    module_radiation_clouds::progcld_fer_hires()
 -    module_radiation_clouds::progcld_thompson_wsm6()
 -    module_radiation_clouds::progclduni()
 -    module_radiation_clouds::progcld_thompson()

- \ref GFS_rrtmg_pre.F90 : Removed the “progcld” subroutine calls, and replaced them with a single subroutine call to module_radiation_clouds::radiation_clouds_prop.

- \ref radiation_cloud_overlap.F90 : Replaced subroutine “get_alpha_exp” with module_radiation_cloud_overlap::get_alpha_exper(). The new subroutine revises alpha for exponential random cloud overlap option. This new subroutine is used in programs GFS_rrtmgp_cloud_overlap_pre.F90 and GFS_rrtmgp_gfdlmp_pre.F90.

- Subroutine module_radiation_clouds::gethml() has been modified. The subroutine computes low, mid, high, total and boundary clouds, and is used in GFS_cloud_diagnostics.F90.
