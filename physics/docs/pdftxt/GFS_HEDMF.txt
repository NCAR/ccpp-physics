\section des_pbl Description
The Hybrid EDMF scheme is a first-order turbulent transport 
scheme used for subgrid-scale vertical turbulent mixing in the PBL 
and above. It blends the traditional first-order approach that has 
been used and improved over the last several years with a more recent 
scheme that uses a mass-flux approach to calculate the countergradient 
diffusion terms.

The PBL scheme's main task is to calculate tendencies of temperature, 
moisture, and momentum due to vertical diffusion throughout the column 
(not just the PBL). The scheme is an amalgamation of decades of work, 
starting from the initial first-order PBL scheme of Troen and Mahrt (1986) 
\cite troen_and_mahrt_1986, implemented according to Hong and Pan (1996) 
\cite hong_and_pan_1996 and modified by Han and Pan (2011) 
\cite han_and_pan_2011 and Han et al.(2016) \cite Han_2016 to 
include top-down mixing due to stratocumulus layers from Lock et al. (2000) 
\cite lock_et_al_2000 and replacement of counter-gradient terms with a mass 
flux scheme according to Siebesma et al.(2007) \cite siebesma_et_al_2007 
and Soares et al. (2004) \cite soares_et_al_2004. Recently, heating due to 
TKE dissipation was also added according to Han et al.(2016) \cite Han_2016.

This subroutine contains all of logic for the Hybrid EDMF PBL scheme except 
for the calculation of the updraft properties and mass flux. The scheme 
works on a basic level by calculating background diffusion coefficients 
and updating them according to which processes are occurring in the column. 
The most important difference in diffusion coefficients occurs between 
those levels in the PBL and those above the PBL, so the PBL height 
calculation is of utmost importance. An initial estimate is calculated in a 
"predictor" step in order to calculate Monin-Obukhov similarity values and 
a corrector step recalculates the PBL height based on updated surface 
thermal characteristics. Using the PBL height and the similarity parameters, 
the diffusion coefficients are updated below the PBL top based on Hong and 
Pan (1996) \cite hong_and_pan_1996 (including counter-gradient terms). 
Diffusion coefficients in the free troposphere (above the PBL top) are 
calculated according to Louis (1979) \cite louis_1979 with updated 
Richardson number-dependent functions. If it is diagnosed that PBL top-down 
mixing is occurring according to Lock et al. (2000) \cite lock_et_al_2000 , 
then then diffusion coefficients are updated accordingly. Finally, for 
convective boundary layers (defined as when the Obukhov length exceeds a 
threshold), the counter-gradient terms are replaced using the mass flux 
scheme of Siebesma et al. (2007) \cite siebesma_et_al_2007 . In order to 
return time tendencies, a fully implicit solution is found using tridiagonal 
matrices, and time tendencies are "backed out." Before returning, the time 
tendency of temperature is updated to reflect heating due to TKE 
dissipation following Han et al. (2016) \cite Han_2016 .
