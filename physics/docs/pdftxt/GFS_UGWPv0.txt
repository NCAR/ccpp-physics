\section des_UGWP Description

Gravity waves (GWs) are generated by a variety of sources in the atmosphere 
including orographic GWs (OGWs; quasi-stationary waves) and non-orographic 
GWs (NGWs; non-stationary oscillations). When the Version 0 of the Unified
Gravity Wave Physics (UGWP v0) is invoked, the subgrid OGWs and NGWs are
parameterized. For the subgrid-scale parameterization of OGWs, the UGWP
invokes a separate scheme, the \subpage GFS_GWDPS, which is used in the operational
Global Forecast System (GFS) version 15. 

The NGW physics scheme parameterizes the effects of non-stationary  waves 
unresolved by dynamical cores. These non-stationary oscillations with periods 
bounded by Coriolis and Brunt-Väisälä frequencies and typical horizontal 
scales from tens to several hundreds of kilometers,  are forced by the 
imbalance of convective and frontal/jet dynamics in the troposphere and 
lower stratosphere (Fritts 1984 \cite fritts_1984; Alexander et al. 
2010 \cite alexander_et_al_2010; Plougonven and Zhang 2014 \cite plougonven_and_zhang_2014). 
The NGWs propagate upwards and the amplitudes exponentially grow with 
altitude until instability and breaking of waves occur. Convective and 
dynamical instability induced by GWs with large amplitudes can trigger 
production of small-scale turbulence and self-destruction of waves. 
The latter process in the theory of atmospheric GWs is frequently referred
as the wave saturation (Lindzen 1981 \cite lindzen_1981; Weinstock 
1984 \cite weinstock_1984; Fritts 1984 \cite fritts_1984). Herein, 
“saturation” or "breaking" refers to any processes that act to reduce 
wave amplitudes due to instabilities and/or interactions arising from 
large-amplitude perturbations limiting the exponential growth of GWs 
with height. Background dissipation processes such as molecular diffusion 
and radiative cooling, in contrast, act independently of GW amplitudes. 
In the middle atmosphere, impacts of NGW saturation (or breaking) and 
dissipation on the large-scale circulation, mixing, and transport have 
been acknowledged in the physics of global weather and climate models 
after pioneering studies by Lindzen 1981 \cite lindzen_1981 and Holton 
1983 \cite holton_1983. Comprehensive reviews on the physics of NGWs 
and OGWs in climate and weather models have been discussted in Alexander 
et al. 2010 \cite alexander_et_al_2010, Geller et al. 
2013 \cite geller_et_al_2013, and Garcia et al. 2017 \cite garcia_et_al_2017. 
They are formulated using different aspects of the nonlinear and linear 
propagation, instability, breaking and dissipation of waves along with 
different specifications of GW sources (Garcia et al. 2007 \cite garcia_et_al_2007;
Richter et al 2010 \cite richter_et_al_2010; Eckermann et al. 
2009 \cite eckermann_et_al_2009; Eckermann 2011 \cite eckermann_2011; 
Lott et al. 2012 \cite lott_et_al_2012).

Several studies have demonstrated the importance of NGW physics to improve
model predictions in the stratosphere and upper atmosphere (Alexander et al.
 2010 \cite alexander_et_al_2010; Geller et al. 2013). In order to describe 
the effects of unresolved GWs in global forecast models, the representation of
subgrid OGWs and NGWs has been implemented in the self-consistent manner using the 
UGWP framework.

The concept of UGWP was first proposed and implemented in the Unified 
Forecast System (UFS)with model top at different levels by scientists from
the University of Colorado Cooperative Institute for Research in the 
Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) 
and from NOAA's Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) (Alpert et al. 
2019 \cite alpert_et_al_2019; Yudin et al. 2016 \cite yudin_et_al_2016; 
Yudin et al. 2018 \cite yudin_et_al_2018). The UGWP considers identical 
GW propagation solvers for OGWs and NGWs with different approaches for 
specification of subgrid wave sources. The current set of the input and
control paramters for UGWP version 0 (UGWP v0) enables options for GW
effects, including momentum deposition (also called GW drag), heat 
deposition, and mixing by eddy viscosity, conductivity and diffusion; 
however, note that the eddy mixing effects induced by instability of GWs
are not activated in this version.

Namelist paramters control the number of directional azimuths in which
waves can propagate, number of waves in a single direction, and the level
above the surface at which NGWs can be launched. Among the input parameters,
the GW efficiency factors reflect intermittency of wave excitation.
They should vary with horizontal resolution, reflecting the capability of
the dynamical core to resolve mesoscale wave activity with the enhancement
of model resolution.

Prescribed distributions for vertical momentum flux (VMF) of NGWs have been employed 
in global numerical weather prediction and reanalysis models to ease tuning of GW 
schemes to the climatology of the middle atmosphere dynamics in the absence of 
the global wind data above about 35 km (Eckermann et al. 2009 \cite eckermann_et_al_2009; 
Molod et al. 2015 \cite molod_et_al_2015). These distributions of VMF 
qualitatively describe the general features of the latitudinal and seasonal
 variations of the global GW activity in the lower stratosphere, observed from the 
ground and space (Ern et al. 2018 \cite ern_et_al_2018). Subgrid GW sources can also be 
parameterized to respond to year-to-year variations of solar input and 
anthropogenic emissions (Richter et al 2010 \cite richter_et_al_2010; 
2014 \cite richter_et_al_2014).

Note that in UGWP v0, the momentum and heat deposition due to GW breaking 
and dissipation have been tested in the multi-year simulations and 
medium-range forecasts using a configuration of the UFS weather model 
using 127 levels with model top at approximately 80 km. 

Along with the GW heat and momentum depositions, GW eddy mixing is an 
important element of the Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM) physics, as shown 
in WAM simulations with the spectral dynamics (Yudin et al. 2018 \cite yudin_et_al_2018). 
The impact of eddy mixing effects in the middle and upper atmosphere, 
which is not included in this version, need to be tested, evaluated, and
orchestrated with the representation of the subgrid turbulent diffusion and 
the numerical dissipation.

The representation of subgrid GWs is particularly important for WAMs that 
extend into the thermosphere (top lid at ~600 km). In the mesosphere and 
thermosphere, the background attenuation of subgrid waves due to molecular 
and turbulent diffusion, radiative damping and ion drag will be the 
additional mechanism of NGW and OGW dissipation along with convective 
and dynamical instability of waves described by the linear 
(Lindzen 1981 \cite lindzen_1981) and nonlinear 
(Weinstock 1984 \cite weinstock_1984; Hines 1997 \cite hines_1997) saturation theories.
