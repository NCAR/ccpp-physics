\section des_deep Description
 The scale-aware mass-flux (SAMF) deep convection scheme is an
 updated version of the previous Simplified Arakawa-Schubert (SAS) scheme
 with scale and aerosol awareness and parameterizes the effect of deep
 convection on the environment (represented by the model state variables)
 in the following way. First, a simple cloud model is used to determine
 the change in model state variables due to one entraining/detraining cloud
 type, per unit cloud-base mass flux. Next, the total change in state variables
 is retrieved by determining the actual cloud base mass flux using the
 quasi-equilibrium assumption (for grid sizes larger than a threshold value
 [currently set to 8 km]) or a mean updraft velocity (for grid sizes smaller
 than the threshold value). With a scale-aware parameterization, the
 cloud mass flux decreases with increasing grid resolution. A simple
 aerosol-aware parameterization is employed, where rain conversion in
 the convective updraft is modified by aerosol number concentration.
 The name SAS is replaced with SAMF as for the smaller grid sizes,
 the parameterization does not use Arakawa-Schubert's quasi-equilibrium
 assumption any longer where the cloud work function (interpreted as
 entrainment-moderated convective available potential energy [CAPE])
 by the large scale dynamics is in balance with the consumption of the
 cloud work function by the convection.

 The SAS scheme uses the working concepts put forth 
 in Arakawa and Schubert (1974) \cite arakawa_and_schubert_1974 but includes modifications
 and simplifications from Grell (1993) \cite grell_1993 such as saturated
 downdrafts and only one cloud type (the deepest possible), rather than
 a spectrum based on cloud top heights or assumed entrainment rates.
 The scheme was implemented for the GFS in 1995 by Pan and Wu (1995) \cite pan_and_wu_1995, 
 with further modifications discussed in Han and Pan (2011) \cite han_and_pan_2011 , including the calculation
 of cloud top, a greater CFL-criterion-based maximum cloud base mass flux,
 updated cloud model entrainment and detrainment, improved convective
 transport of horizontal momentum, a more general triggering function,
 and the inclusion of convective overshooting.

 The SAMF scheme updates the SAS scheme with scale- and aerosol-aware
 parameterizations from Han et al. (2017) \cite han_et_al_2017 based on
 the studies by Arakawa and Wu (2013) \cite arakawa_and_wu_2013 and 
 Grell and Freitas (2014) \cite grell_and_freitas_2014 for scale awareness
 and Lim (2011) by \cite lim_2011 for aerosol awareness. The ratio of
 advective time to convective turnover time is also taken into account
 for the scale-aware parameterization. Along with the scale- and aerosol-aware
 parameterizations, more changes are made to the SAMF scheme. The cloud
 base mass-flux computation is modified to use convective turnover time
 as the convective adjustment time scale. The rain conversion rate is
 modified to decrease with decreasing air temperature above the freezing
 level. Convective inhibition in the sub-cloud layer is used as an additional
 trigger condition. Convective cloudiness is enhanced by considering suspended
 cloud condensate in the updraft. The lateral entrainment is also enhanced
 to more strongly suppress convection in a drier environment.

 In further update for FY19 GFS implementation, interaction with turbulent
 kinetic energy (TKE), which is a prognostic variable used in a scale-aware
 TKE-based moist EDMF vertical turbulent mixing scheme, is included.
 Entrainment rates in updrafts and downdrafts are proportional to sub-cloud
 mean TKE. TKE is transported by cumulus convection. TKE contribution from
 cumulus convection is deduced from cumulus mass flux. On the other hand,
 tracers such as ozone and aerosol are also transported by cumulus convection.

 Occasional model crashes have been occurred when stochastic physics is on,
 due to too much convective cooling and heating tendencies near the cumulus
 top which are amplified by stochastic physics. To reduce too much convective
 cooling at the cloud top, the convection schemes have been modified for the
 rain conversion rate, entrainment and detrainment rates, overshooting layers,
 and maximum allowable cloudbase mass flux (as of June 2018).

\subsection ca_page Cellular Automata Stochastic Convective Organization Scheme 

\b Scientific \b Background

Cumulus clouds in the atmosphere can organize into a variety of sizes, ranging 
from small fair‐weather cumulus clouds, rain showers and thunderstorms, to 
larger scale weather systems. In weather and climate models, such organization 
is traditionally not well-represented as the motions associated with cumulus 
clouds are generally too small to be resolved by the numerical model. 
In this scheme we use a stochastic cellular automaton (CA), a mathematical 
model often used to describe self‐organizing behavior in physical systems to 
represent the effects of convective organization. The scheme addresses the 
effect of convective organization in a bulk-plume cumulus convection 
parameterizations (saSAS), where this type of organization has to be 
represented in terms of how the resolved flow would “feel” convection if 
more coherent structures were present on the subgrid.  

In addition, for longer range forecasts (seasonal, decadal, climate), 
the relevance of stochastic cumulus convection in numerical models can also 
be discussed in terms of noise induced forcing. As an example, on the 
time scale of organized convectively coupled waves, the small scale individual 
convective plumes grow and decay so rapidly that they are not predictable 
on time-scales longer than a few hours, whereas the organized larger scale 
convectively coupled wave envelope can have a deterministic limit of 
predictability of about two weeks. Thus, for longer range forecasts, 
individual convective plumes can be viewed as stochastic noise - they can 
have an impact on the convectively coupled waves (due to noise forcing), 
but they are not predictable on their own. By providing the CA with a 
stochastic initialization, the effect of stochastic cumulus convection 
is also represented by the scheme. 

The scientific motivation for the scheme, the CA rulesets explored, and 
the impact on convectively coupled equatorial waves can be found in the 
following references; Bengtsson et al. 2011 \cite Bengtsson_2011,

\b Technical \b remarks

The CA source code is located in the stochastic physics submodule in 
the ufs-weather-model: https://github.com/noaa-psd/stochastic_physics . 
In the UFS Weather Model, the main call to the CA routines are made 
from FV3/stochastic_physics_driver.F90. 

There are currently two options to evolve the CA (can be done simultaneously); 
(\p ca_global) a large scale global pattern which evolves the ruleset according 
to game of life with cell history, or (\p ca_sgs) a sub-grid scale pattern 
which is conditioned on a forcing from the atmospheric model. The two options 
are controlled by namelist and are evolved in cellular_automata_globa.F90 
and cellular_automata_sgs.F90 respectively. Both approaches use the main 
CA module update_ca.F90 to evolve the CA in time. Since the CA needs to know 
about its neighborhood it uses the halo information to gather the state 
in adjacent MPI domains and/or adjacent cube sphere interfaces. 

\b The \p ca_sgs \b option - \b Coupled \b to \b saSAS \b cumulus \b convection \b scheme

The evolution of the CA is an extension to the automaton family known as “Generations,” 
which in turn is based on the “Game of Life”(Chopard & Droz, 1998 \cite Chopard_1998)
 but adds cell history to the rule set. It is a deterministic CA ruleset, initialized 
with Gaussian white noise. Thus, when used in an ensemble system, each ensemble 
member can provide a different seed to the random number generator governing 
the initial state to then generate a different evolution for each member. 
By cell history we refer to newborn cells being given a “lifetime,”τ, 
that is incrementally reduced by 1 each time step where the rules are not met,
 in contrast to going directly from 1 to 0. The CA is conditioned on a 
forcing from the host model through the lifetime variable τ such that:

\f[
\tau =N\left( \frac{\int_{l=1}^{l=top}E\frac{dp }{g} }{\max\left( \int_{l=1}^{l=top} E\frac{d p}{g}\right)} \right)
\f]

here, N is an integer that when multiplied by the model time-step represents 
a physical time scale, such that τ is longer in regions where the forcing is larger, 
E is the vertically integrated convective rain evaporation from the 
saSAS cumulus convection scheme stored in Coupling%condition. The denominator is 
the maximum value of the forcing in the global domain. While the grid-scale 
forcing in practice could be any two-dimensional field, we choose here 
to set it as the vertically integrated subgrid rain evaporation amount, 
serving as an indicator of geographical regions where enhanced subgrid 
organization may arise through convective cold-pools.

The CA is evolved on a finer grid than the numerical prediction 
host model (size controlled by namelist), and can be either coarse 
grained back to the host model grid as a fraction, or (in case of \p nca_plumes = .true.) 
give back the maximum number of connected “plumes” (represented by 
connected CA cells), and their associated size within each numerical 
prediction host model grid-box. nca_plumes is default true and the 
maximum cluster size is passed to the saSAS cumulus convection scheme 
in the Coupling%ca_deep container. 

Depending on the activated namelist options, the CA can feed back to 
the saSAS convection scheme via the entrainment (\p ca_entr), closure 
(\p ca_closure) or convective initiation (\p ca_trigger) in the following way:

- Entrainment (\p ca_entr): In entraining plume model bulk mass-flux schemes, 
the upward mass-flux is typically parameterized as a function of environmental 
air being entrained into the rising plume (as well as parcel properties at 
cloud base). The fractional entrainment is described as a function of the 
plume radius. Larger thermals (plumes) have smaller fractional entrainment, 
which is a consequence of the fact that larger areas have relatively smaller 
perimeters. In this scheme, the assumption is that subgrid organization will 
lead to a few larger plumes rather than several smaller plumes, such that 
the grid-box average fractional entrainment is reduced. Thus, after 
the CA is updated, we count the number of plumes, and their associated 
size within each NWP grid-box (\p nca_plumes = true). If the largest 
cluster of cells found on the subgrid is larger than a set radius, then the 
fractional entrainment rate is reduced at that grid-point by 30% 
(selected based on experimentation)

- Triggering (\p ca_trigger): In NWP models physical processes are parameterized 
in columns, and the horizontal interaction between physical processes takes 
place only through advection and diffusion. As the CA can organize clusters 
across adjacent NWP model grid-boxes, the method offers a novel approach to 
enhance the probability of triggering of convection in nearby areas, 
representing subgrid fluctuations in temperature and humidity, and triggering 
in premoistened regions if convection is triggered in a cluster. The 
stochastic nature of the CA may enhance organization in different 
directions within the grid-box, and across grid-boxes, depending on the 
initial seed. If the model is run as an ensemble, the convection scheme's 
stochastic triggering function can help to improve uncertainty estimates 
associated with subgrid fluctuations of temperature and humidity and 
randomness in organization. In this work, model grid boxes in which the 
CA's largest connecting plume exceeds a given threshold will be considered 
as candidates for convective activation, in addition to saSAS’s current 
triggering criteria.

- Closure (\p ca_closure): We assume that convection that organizes into 
plumes with larger radii tends to cover a larger area fraction of the 
grid-box and thereby acts to enhance the cloud base mass flux. In this 
coupling strategy, we again count the number of plumes (represented by 
connected cellular automaton cells), and their associated size within 
each NWP grid-box. If the largest cluster of cells found on the subgrid 
is larger than a set radius, then the cloud base mass-flux is enhanced in 
that grid-box by 25% (selected based on experimentation). This option is 
being revisited by reformulating the entire closure using a prognostic 
evolution of the updraft area fraction, and is in its current formulation 
not recommended. 

\subsection gen_enh Physics Updates in GFS Cumulus Convection

- To enhance the surface-based convective available potential energy (CAPE), 
more strict convection trigger conditions are applied.
- Enhanced downdraft detrainments start from 60 mb above the ground surface 
rather than from the cloud base.
- Reduced rain evaporation with the removal of wind shear dependency, which 
helps to reduce cold bias in tropospheric temperature profile especially over Tropics.
- Separation cloud depth of deep and shallow convection is 
increased to 200 hPa from 150 hPa.
- Updraft entrainment rates for moisture, hydrometeors, and tracers are 
increased by about 30%.
- A positive definite TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) mass-flux transport 
scheme for moisture, hydrometeors and tracers and a method for removing negative tracer mixing ratio values have been implemented.
