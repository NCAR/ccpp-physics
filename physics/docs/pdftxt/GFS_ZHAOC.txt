\section des_zhao Description
 This is the GFS scheme for grid-scale condensation and precipitation which is based on
 Zhao and Carr (1997) \cite zhao_and_carr_1997 and Sundqvist et al. (1989) \cite sundqvist_et_al_1989 .
 The main feature of this parameterization is the inclusion of cloud water and cloud ice in both the 
 convective and grid-scale precipitation paramterizations, and use only one predictive variable, the 
 cloud water/ice mixing ratio \f$m\f$, to represent both cloud water and cloud ice. This will reduce 
 the model computation time and storage requirements.

 Figure 1 shows a  schematic illustration of this scheme.
 There are two sources of prognostic cloud condensate, namely convective
 detrainment (samfdeepcnv_run() and samfshalcnv_run()) and grid-sale condensation (zhaocarr_gscond_run()). 
 Both of them produce either cloud water or cloud ice, depending on
 the cloud substance at and above the grid point at current and previous time steps, and on the temperature. Evaporation of 
 cloud is allowed at points where the relative humidity is lower than the critical value required for condensation. Precipitation
 is diagnostically calculated directly from the cloud water/ice mixing ratio. Both frozen and liquid precipitation can be 
 prognostically produced, enabling this scheme to predict precipitation type.

 The parameterization of precipitation is required in order to remove
 water from the atmosphere and transport it to the ground.
 For the precipitation production, only the principle microphysical processes associated with formation of rain and 
 snow are inlcuded. Figure 2 presents the microphysical processes considered in the microphysics scheme. Basically, 
 there are four types of microphysical processes considered here:
 + Production of rain from cloud water (\f$P_{racw}\f$, \f$P_{raut}\f$, \f$P_{sacw}\f$)
 + Production of snow from cloud ice (\f$P_{saut}\f$, \f$P_{saci}\f$)
 + Melting of snow to form rain below the freezing level (\f$P_{sm1}\f$, \f$P_{sm2}\f$)
 + Evaporation of precipitation (\f$E_{rr}\f$, \f$E_{rs}\f$)

 Some processes, such as the freezing of raindrops and the interaction between rain drops and cloud ice, have been ignored
 since the upward motion on the synoptic scale is too weak to advect the raindrops upward. Additionally, precipitation is
 diagnostically calculated directly from the cloud mixing ratio.
