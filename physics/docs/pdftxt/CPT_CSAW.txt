\section cs_descrip  Description

The Chikira-Sugiyama cumulus scheme (Chikira and Sugiyama (2010) \cite Chikira_2010) with prognostic closure and
Arakawa-Wu Scale-Aware extension \cite Arakawa_2013 is an offshoot of the prognostic Arakawa-Schubert scheme. 
It is characterized by a spectral representation of cloud types according to updraft velocity at cloud base, a level
at which the mass flux is determined by a convective kinetic energy closure. The
lateral entrainment rate vertically varies depending on the buoyancy and vertical 
velocity of the updraft air parcel following Gregory (2001) \cite Gregory_2001 . 
 The entrainment rate tends to be large near cloud base because of the small updraft
velocity near that level. Deep convection tends to be suppressed when convective available potential energy 
is small because of upward reduction of in-cloud moist static energy. Dry environment air significantly reduces
in-cloud humidity mainly because of the large entrainment rate in the lower troposphere, which leads to suppression
of deep convection, consistent with observations and previous of cloud-resolving models.
