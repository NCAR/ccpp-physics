\section des_rayleigh  Description
This is the Rayleigh friction calculation with total energy conservation.
\n Role of Rayleigh friction, it attempts to resolve two issues:
 - The top lid model effects, sponge layer to suppress resolved wave reflections and extra-heating
 - The winter-summer zonal wind drag in the strato-mesosphere
