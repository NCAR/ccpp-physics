\section des_ugwpv1 Description
The "ugwpv1_gsldrag" combines the orographic gravity wave drag (GWD) parameterizations of the GSL drag suite with the version 1 UGWP non-stationary gravity wave drag (NGW) scheme of \cite yudin_et_al_2020.

The NGW physics scheme parameterizes the effects of non-stationary  waves 
unresolved by dynamical cores. These non-stationary oscillations with periods 
bounded by Coriolis and Brunt-Väisälä frequencies and typical horizontal 
scales from tens to several hundreds of kilometers,  are forced by the 
imbalance of convective and frontal/jet dynamics in the troposphere and 
lower stratosphere (Fritts 1984 \cite fritts_1984; Alexander et al. 
2010 \cite alexander_et_al_2010; Plougonven and Zhang 2014 \cite plougonven_and_zhang_2014). 
The NGWs propagate upwards and the amplitudes exponentially grow with 
altitude until instability and breaking of waves occur. Convective and 
dynamical instability induced by GWs with large amplitudes can trigger 
production of small-scale turbulence and self-destruction of waves. 
The latter process in the theory of atmospheric GWs is frequently referred
as the wave saturation (Lindzen 1981 \cite lindzen_1981; Weinstock 
1984 \cite weinstock_1984; Fritts 1984 \cite fritts_1984). Herein, 
“saturation” or "breaking" refers to any processes that act to reduce 
wave amplitudes due to instabilities and/or interactions arising from 
large-amplitude perturbations limiting the exponential growth of GWs 
with height. Background dissipation processes such as molecular diffusion 
and radiative cooling, in contrast, act independently of GW amplitudes. 
In the middle atmosphere, impacts of NGW saturation (or breaking) and 
dissipation on the large-scale circulation, mixing, and transport have 
been acknowledged in the physics of global weather and climate models 
after pioneering studies by Lindzen 1981 \cite lindzen_1981 and Holton 
1983 \cite holton_1983. Comprehensive reviews on the physics of NGWs 
and OGWs in climate and weather models have been discussted in Alexander 
et al. 2010 \cite alexander_et_al_2010, Geller et al. 
2013 \cite geller_et_al_2013, and Garcia et al. 2017 \cite garcia_et_al_2017. 
They are formulated using different aspects of the nonlinear and linear 
propagation, instability, breaking and dissipation of waves along with 
different specifications of GW sources (Garcia et al. 2007 \cite garcia_et_al_2007;
Richter et al 2010 \cite richter_et_al_2010; Eckermann et al. 
2009 \cite eckermann_et_al_2009; Eckermann 2011 \cite eckermann_2011; 
Lott et al. 2012 \cite lott_et_al_2012).

Several studies have demonstrated the importance of NGW physics to improve
model predictions in the stratosphere and upper atmosphere (Alexander et al.
 2010 \cite alexander_et_al_2010; Geller et al. 2013). In order to describe 
the effects of unresolved GWs in global forecast models, the representation of
subgrid OGWs and NGWs has been implemented in the self-consistent manner using the 
UGWP framework.
