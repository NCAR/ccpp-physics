\section des_sice Description
 Sea ice is a thin skin of frozen water covering the polar oceans.  The sea ice strongly 
 interacts with both the atmosphere above and the ocean underneath in the high
 latitudes. In a coupled weather/climate system, changes in sea ice extent, thickness and concentration
 regionally or globally would influence oceanic and atmospheric conditions, which in turn affect the
 sea ice distribution. The physical and dynamical processes affecting the weather and climate are
 considered as follows:
 + The high albedo of the sea ice reflects more solar radiation back to the space. The feedbacks are
 considered as positive. The broader the sea ice cover, the higher the surface albedo, which result
 in less amount of solar radiation absorbed at the Earth's surface. A cooler surface would favor more
 sea ice to form. The process would be reversed in less sea ice situation.
 + The sea ice restricts the heat/water exchange between the air and ocean. The presence of extensive
 areas of sea ice would suppress the heat loss in winter and the heat gain in summer by the ocean.
 Even a thin ice cover influences the turbulent heat transfer significantly between ocean and
 atmosphere. The surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat can be greater by up to two orders of magnitude
 at the open water surface of a lead or polynya than that through (snow covered) pack ice.
 + The sea ice modifies air/sea momentum transfer, ocean fresh water balance and ocean circulation.
 The freezing and melting of the ocean surface and the associated fluxes of salt and heat produce major
 changes in the density structure of the polar water. Formation of sea ice injects salt into the ocean
 makes the water heavier and more convectively unstable, conversely when melting occurs, stable and fresh
 layers can prevent deep covective activity.

 A sea ice model, in general, may contain subcomponents treating 1) dynamics (ice motion),
 2) ice transport, 3) multiple ice thickness categories (including leads), 4) surface albedo,
 and 5) vertical thermodynamics. GFS sea ice scheme is concerned with a scheme for the
 last of these processes. A three-layer thermodynamic sea ice model (Winton (2000) \cite winton_2000) 
 has been coupled to GFS. It predicts sea ice/snow thickness,
 the surface temperature and ice temperature structure. In each model grid box, the heat and moisture
 fluxes and albedo are treated separately for the ice and the open water.
