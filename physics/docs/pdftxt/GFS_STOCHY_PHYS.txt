\section des_stochy Description
Quantification of forecast uncertainties became established in operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) in the 1990s
using ensemble forecasting techniques (Lewis(2005) \cite Lewis_2005). Building an ensemble forecast system requires the 
specification of the sources of uncertainties. It seems conventionally to distinguish between uncertainties in the initial 
conditions (i.e. initial uncertainties) and uncertainties in the forecast model (i.e. model uncertainties). An ensemble 
that represents only initial uncertainties consistent with the true distribution of initial condition errors is known to be 
underdispersive and therefore will lack reliability (Wilks (2005) \cite Wilks_2005). This motivates the development of methodologies
to represent model uncertainties.

Traditionally, physical parameterization schemes were assumed to be deterministic, producing representations of small-scale
processes unique to the resolved-scale atmospheric state. This assumption becomes increasingly problematic as computational
advances permit more accurate simulations at finer resolutions where small-scale processes exhibit more stochastic qualities.
Small-scale convective fluctuations often interact strongly with the nonlinear flow dynamics, with substantial repercussions
for large-scale model evolution. Producing accurate and reliable probabilistic predictions therefore depends critically on
representations of parameterization uncertainties.

In the 2015 GFS implementation, new stochastic physics schemes were employed to represent model error to replace
the artificial additive inflation. The upgraded stochastic physics suite has three components, including:
- Stochastically Perturbed Physics Tendencies (\b SPPT; Buizza et al. 1999 \cite buizza_et_al_1999 ; Palmer (1997)
\cite palmer_1997 ; Palmer (2001) \cite Palmer_2001)
- Stochastically Perturbed Boundary Layer Specific Humidity (\b SHUM; Tompkins and Berner (2008) \cite tompkins_and_berner_2008)
- Stochastic Kinetic Energy Backscatter (\b SKEB; Berner et al. 2009 \cite berner_et_al_2009; Shutts (2005) \cite Shutts_2005)

These schemes have already been implemented in the hybrid-EnKF data assimilation system of GFS, making them readily available for 
use in the GEFS. GFS generates radom patterns in spectral space, and transforms patterns to a Gaussian grid. In FV3GFS 2019 
implementation, FV3GFS will still uses spectral patterns in spectral space, transporms them to a Gaussian grid, then interpolates
to model's cubed-sphere grid.  

SPPT makes the assumption that the dominant error of the parameterized physics tendency is proportional to the net 
physics tendency (Buizza et al.(1999) \cite buizza_et_al_1999). SPPT generates perturbed parameterization tendencies \f$P\f$ 
stochastically by multiplying the net physics tendency \f$P_D\f$ provided by the physics package with a 2D random field \f$r\f$:
\f[
P=(1+\mu r)P_{D}
\f]
Here, \f$P\f$ denotes the vector of perturbed tendencies of temperature, specific humidity and wind components in a model column.
The factor \f$\mu\f$ is an optional tapering function that depends on the model level only and has values in the range [0,1].
In FV3GFS, SPPT perturbs the combined tendencies of wind, temperature, and water vapor produced by the CCPP-Physics parameterizations (excluding
clear-air radiation). The implementaion use a first-order auto-regrassive  (AR(1)) random pattern generator (see get_stochy_pattern_mod)
to produce spatially and temporally correlated perturbations with three different horizontal length/time scales 500 km/0.25 days, 
1000 km/3 days and 2000 km/30 days, and standard deviations of 0.8, 0.4 and 0.2 respectively. Zhu et al.(2018) \cite Zhu_2018 
show an example of a realization of the three components. The above nine numbers are meant to span the uncertainty at mesoscale, 
synoptic scale and planetary space and time scales with pattern 1 (500 km decorrelation scale) being the starting point and most 
important component for the medium-range ensemble prediction system. The patterns are uniform in the vertical, except they are
reduced in magnitude near the surface and tapered to zero near and above the tropopause. The latter is done to avoid large amplitude
perturbations of the radiative tendencies in the stratosphere, which are presumed to be more accurate, and the former to avoid
numerical instabilities in the boundary layer.

SHUM introduces stochastic perturbation to represent model uncertainty of humidity. It perturbs the near-surface humidity state
to present subgrid distribution and variability through convection. SHUM uses the same random pattern generator as SPPT, but only
a single spatial-temporal scale is used. The perturbation is maximized in the lowest model level and decreased exponentially with
height.

SKEB is used to represent uncertainty in representing the upscale impacts from subgrid-scale processes. This is done via a stream
function forcing based on the dissipation rate. The 2015 GFS implementation of SKEB only considers \b numerical \b dissipation (diffusion) 
based on the vorticity gradient, and smoothed in spectral space. FV3 core calculates \b Kinetic \b Energy loss at each time step
in terms of a heat source that is added to the temperature equation. This loss smoothed in grid-point space for SKEB.

\n For the vertical correlation of random patterns, GFS produces a unique random pattern at every model level, then smoothed in the 
vertical using 40 passes of a 1-2-1 filter. Update to FV3GFS is to use the evolution of the random patterns over time to create
vertical correlation. The pattern are saved on an independent vertical coordinate and interpolated to model levels. This allows for 
a seperation of vertical and temporal correlation but only needing to carry one random pattern.

Figure 3 of Zhu et al.(2018) \cite Zhu_2018 shows the impact of the individual stochastic schemes in the current operational GFS  
on ensemble spread at 144 hr (average of six spring cases and six fall cases) when compared to ensemble spread without introducing 
stochastic perturbations. The stochastic system used in the control (previously operational GEFS),STTP,produces additional spread 
in the extratropics but has little impact in the tropics. Of the components in the stochastic physics suite, SKEB produces additional
spread in similar areas as STTP
(though slightly muted). The other two components,SPPT and SHUM, both increase spread in the tropics where the control system is 
deficient. SPPT also has an impact in the spring/summer hemisphere. In combination, these stochastic schemes generally improve forecast
uncertainty, particularly in the tropics, which may lead to improvements in tropical forecast skill.

In 2019 FV3GFS implementation, only the SHUM and SPPT are included as stochastic physics in the EnKF. The SKEB was not available to 
be used at the time the code was frozen, and the amplitude parameters for SHUM and SPPT were modified to compensate.
