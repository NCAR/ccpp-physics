\page ccppv7_phy Physics Update Summary

This page provides an overview of the major updates in CCPP Physics v7.0.0.

\b General \b Changes:
- New supported suites: GFS_v17_p8_ugwpv1, GFS_v16_RRTMGP, and HRRR_gf suites 
- New \ref CLM_LAKE_page in HRRR_gf suite
- New \ref ugwpv1_gsldrag in GFS_v17_p8_ugwpv1 suite combines the \ref GFS_drag_suite with the version 1 UGWP non-stationary gravity wave drag (NGW) scheme of  Yudin et al. (2020)\cite yudin_et_al_2020 
- New \ref GFS_RRTMGP_page (Pincus et al. 2019 \cite pincus_et_al_2019) in GFS_v16_RRTMGP suite

Suites GFS_v17_p8, HRRR, RRFS_v1beta, and RAP, which were supported with CCPP v6.0.0, have been phased out.


\b GFS  \b Scale-aware \b SAS  \b Cumulus \b Schemes:

The updates between GFSv16 and GFSv17 are carefully outlined in Bengtsson and Han (2024)(submitted to \a Weather \a and \a Forecasting). The main updates include:
- Implementation of a positive definition mass-flux scheme and a method for removing the negative tracers (Han et al. 2022 \cite Han_et_al_2022)
- Introduction of a new closure based on a prognostic evolution of the convective updraft area fraction in both shallow and deep convection (Bengtsson et al. 2022 \cite Bengtsson_2022)
- Introduction of 3D effects of cold-pool dynamics and stochastic initiation using self-organizing cellular automata stochastic convective organization scheme (not supported in SCM; Bengtsson et al. 2021 \cite bengtsson_et_al_2021)
- Introduction of environmental wind shear effect and subgrid TKE dependence in convection, to seek improvements in hurricane forecast prediction (Han et al. 2024 \cite Han_2024)
- Introduction of stricter convective initiation criteria to allow for more CAPE to build up to address a low CAPE bias in GFSv16 (Han et al. 2021 \cite han_2021)
- Reduction of convective rain evaporation rate to address a systematic cold bias near the surface in GFSv16 (Han et al. 2021 \cite han_2021)

\b Grell-Freitas \b Scale \b and \b Aerosol \b Aware \b Convection \b Scheme:
- Update for aerosol-awareness (experimental and not supported)
- Scale-awareness turned off when explicit microphysics is not active anywhere in the column
- Convection is completely suppressed at grid points where the MYNN PBL sheme produces shallow convection
- Radar reflectivity considers mass flux PDF as well as whether scale-awareness is turned on at the gird point in equation

\b GFS \b Scale-aware \b TKE-EDMF \b PBL \b Scheme:
- Implementation of a parameterization for environmental wind shear effect in the GFS TKE-EDMF PBL and cumulus schemes to reduce 
the negative hurricane intensity biases. 
- Entrainment rates are enhanced proportionally to the sub-cloud or PBL mean TKE (turbulent kinetic energy) when TKE is larger than a threshold value
- Increased entrainment rate as a function of vegetation fraction and surface roughness length to enhance the underestimated CAPE forecasts in the GFS

\sa Han et al.(2024) \cite Han_2024

\b MYNN-EDMF \b PBL \b Scheme:
- Small increase of buoyancy length scale in convective environment
- Patch for ensuring non-zero cloud fractions for all grid cells where cloud mixing ratio is greater than 1e-6 or ice mixing ratio is greater than 1e-9

\b Subgrid-scale (\b SGS) \b Clouds \b Scheme:
- Bug fix for cloud condensate input into RRTMG radiation
- New code section for use with SAS cumulus scheme
- Cloud fraction now computed as a mix between the area-dependent form and the modified Chaboureau and Bechtold (2005) \cite Chaboureau_2005 form
- Adjusted limit for the boundary flux functions

\b Thompson \b Cloud \b Microphysics \b Scheme:
- Ice generation supersaturation requirement reduced from 0.25 to 0.15 to generate more ice at the upper 
levels and reduce the outgoing longwave radiation bias
- Cloud number concentration divided into two parts (over land and others). Number concentration over 
ocean reduced to a smaller number (50/L) from its previous default (100/L). Both changes were made to increase
the downward shortwave radiative flux and reduce the negative bias off coastal regions including the Southeast Pacific
- Small fixes to the minimum size of snow and collision constants

\note The above improvements were tested with the non-aerosol option (in GFS_v17_p8_ugwpv1 suite), so results with the aerosol-aware
Thompson (in HRRR_gf suite) may vary.

\b NSSL \b Cloud \b Microphysics \b Scheme:
- Updated with 3-moment option

\b Radiation
- Coupling of GOCART aerosols with radiation (iaer=2011)
- Convective cloud water (liquid water + ice water) added to the calculations of cloud water path and ice water path for radiation cloud properties

\b NoahMP \b Land \b Surface \b Model:
- Option for using the unified frozen precipitation fraction in NoahMP
- Diagnostic 2-meter temperature and humidity now based on vegetation and bare-ground tiles (new namelist option \a iopt_diag) 
- Bug fixes for GFS-based thermal roughness length scheme
- New soil color dataset introduced to improve soil albedo to reduce the large warm bias found in the Sahel desert
- Wet leaf contribution factor is included
- Leaf-area index now depends on momentum roughness length

\b RUC \b Land \b Surface \b Model:
- Initialization of land and ice emissivity and albedo with consideration of partial snow cover
- Initialization of water vapor mixing ratio over land ice
- Initialization of fractions of soil and vegetation types in a grid cell
- Changes in the computation of a flag for sea ice: set to true only if \a flag_ice=.false. (atmosphere uncoupled from the sea ice model)
- Separate variable for sea ice, for example: \a snowfallac is replaced with \a snowfallac_ice
- Solar angle dependence of albedo for snow-free land
- Stochastic physics perturbations (SPP) introduced for emissivity, albedo and vegetation fraction
- Coefficient in soil resistance formulation (Sakaguchi and Zeng, 2009 \cite sakaguchi_and_zeng_2009) raised from 0.7 to 1.0 to increase soil resistance to evaporation
- Computation of snow cover fraction and snow thermal conductivity updated

\b MYNN \b Surface-layer \b Scheme
- Reintroduce friction velocity averaging over water to reduce noise in 10-m winds in the hurricane regime

\b Unified \b Gravity \b Wave \b Physics \b Scheme:
- Replacement of the resolution-dependent effective grid spacing (cdmbgwd) with a constant (=6dx) 
- Removal of the planetary boundary layer height in determining the reference level
- Weakening of the momentum stress over land ice to reduce the negative wind biases
- Introduction of a launching level to avoid the underestimation of the blocked stress
- Introduction of damped breaking to prevent the wind reversal in the lower troposphere
- Suppression of gravity wave breaking in the upper atmosphere (over 7.5 hPa) to avoid numerical instability
- Revision in sub-grid orography data considering the mathematical definition of moments
