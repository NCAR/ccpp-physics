\b What \b is \b implemented?
- \b SKEB: Stochastic Kinetic Energy Backscatter (Berner et al. 2009 \cite berner_et_al_2009) 
 - Add wind perturbations to model state. Perturbations are random in space/time, but amplitude is determined by a smoothed dissipation
estimate provided by the dynamical core.
 - Addresses errors in the dynamics - more active in the mid-latitudes 

- \b SPPT: Stochastically Perturbed Physics Tendencies (Palmer et al. 2009 \cite palmer_et_al_2009)
 - Multiply the physics tendencies by a random number O[0,2] before updated the model state.
 - Addresses error in the physics parameterizations - most active in boundary layer and convective regions

- \b SHUM: Specific HUMidity perturbations (inspired by Tompkins and Berner (2008) \cite tompkins_and_berner_2008)
 - Multiply the low-level specific humidity by a small random number each time-step.
 - Attempts to address missing physics - most active in convective regions

- \b Land \b surface \b perturbations (Gehne et al.2018 \cite gehne_et_al_2018)
 - Allow for land surface parameters such as Albedo, Soil Hydraulic Conductivity, LAI, roughness
 lengths to vary in space.
 - Address error in the land model
