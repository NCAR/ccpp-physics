\section HAFS_suite_overview Overview

The HAFS_thompson suite is one of the physics suites in the operational HAFS, currently applied in the
National Hurricane Center's Northern Atlantic basin. Wang et al. (2024) \cite Wang_2024 documented the details 
of physics schemes used in HAFS, including a few TC-specific modifications such as roughness length type
and PBL scheme which can be configured through the namelist options. 

The HAFS_thompson suite uses the parameterizations in the following order:
 - \ref GFS_RRTMG_page
 - \ref GFS_SFCLYR
 - \ref GFS_OCEAN
 - \ref GFS_NOAH
 - \ref GFS_SFCSICE
 - \ref GFS_SATMEDMFVDIFQ
 - \ref GFS_UGWP_v0
 - \ref GFS_H2OPHYS
 - \ref GFS_SAMFdeep
 - \ref GFS_SAMFshal
 - \ref THOMPSON
