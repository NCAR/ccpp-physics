\section mynnedmf_descrip  Description

The Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino (Nakanishi and Niino 2009 \cite NAKANISHI_2009) eddy
diffusivity-mass flux (EDMF) scheme was implemented into CCPP to introduce an alternative
turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)-based planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme which could 
serve as a candidate PBL parameterization for future operational implementations of the Unified Forecast System.
The MYNN-EDMF is currently employed in NOAA's operational Rapid Refresh (RAP; Benjamin et al.2016 \cite Benjamin_2016)
and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) forecast systems.

The original MYNN scheme was demonstrated to be an improvement over predecessor Mellor-Yamada-type 
PBL schemes (e.g., Mellor and Yamada 1974,1982 \cite Mellor_1974 \cite Mellor_1982) when compared against large-eddy
simulation (LES) of a convective PBL (Nakanishi and Niino 2004, 2009 \cite Nakanishi_2004 \cite NAKANISHI_2009), the
prediction of advection fog (Nakanishi and Niino 2006 \cite Nakanishi_2006), and for the representation of coastal 
barrier jets (Olson and Brown 2009 \cite olson_and_brown_2009). The MYNN scheme can be configured to function at either
level 2.5 or 3.0 closure and includes a partial-condensation scheme (also known as a cloud PDF or a statistical-cloud
scheme) to represent the effects of subgrid-scale(SGS) clouds on the buoyancy flux (Nakanishi and Niino 2004, 2006, and 2009
\cite Nakanishi_2004 \cite Nakanishi_2006 \cite NAKANISHI_2009). The closure constants for the original MYNN scheme 
were tuned to a database of LES as opposed to observational data.

The MYNN-EDMF scheme has been extensively developed to improve upon the forecast skill of the original MYNN,
largely driven by requirements to improve forecast skill in support of the NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS),
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and users within the renewable-energy industry.Specifically, fundamental
changes were made to the formulation of the mixing lengths and representation of subgrid-scale(SGS) clouds, but new components have also
been added to improve the representation of non-local mixing, the turbulence interaction with clouds, and the coupling to other 
model components (i.e., radiation). A description of the changes to the MYNN scheme are available in Olson et al.(2019) 
\cite olson_et_al_2019.

The SGS clouds produced by the MYNN-EDMF scheme are coupled to the longwave and shortwave radiation schemes
if the namelist parameter \p icloud_bl is set to 1. In this case, the SGS cloud fraction, \p CLDFRA_BL, and the SGS
cloud-mixing ratio, \b QC_BL, are added to the microphysics arrays within the radiation driver (mynnrad_pre_run()). 
The following two steps are performed: 

(1) the cloud fraction of the resolved-scale clouds are computed, using Xu and Randal (1996) \cite xu_and_randall_1996
by default;

(2) if the resolved-scale cloud liquid (\f$q_c\f$) or ice ( \f$q_i\f$), is less than \f$10^{-6}kg kg^{-1}\f$ and
\f$10^{-8}kg kg^{-1}\f$, respectively, and there exists a nonzero SGS cloud fraction, then the SGS components are
added to their respective resolved-scale components by a temperature weighting, according to linear approximation
of Hobbs et al.(1974) \cite HOBBS_1974 :
\f[
 W_{ice}=1-min(1,max(0,(T-254)/15))
 W_{h2o}=1-W_{ice}
\f]

Then we sort the SGS cloud water and liquid as :

\f$q_c\f$=QC_BL*\f$W_{h2o}\f$*CLDFRA_BL

\f$q_i\f$=QC_BL*\f$W_{ice}\f$*CLDFRA_BL

This allows us to only use one 3-D array for both SGS cloud water and ice. The updated \f$q_{c}\f$,\f$q_{i}\f$, and
\p CLDFRA are then used as input into the radiation schemes. After exiting the radiation schemes, the original 
values of \f$q_c, q_i\f$  and \p CLDFRA are restored, so the SGS clouds do not impact the resolved-scale moisture budget.
