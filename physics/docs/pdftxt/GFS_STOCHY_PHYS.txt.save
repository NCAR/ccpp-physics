\section des_stochy Description
Traditionally, physical parameterization schemes were assumed to be deterministic, producing representations of small-scale
processes unique to the resolved-scale atmospheric state. This assumption becomes increasingly problematic as computational 
advances permit more accurate simulations at finer resolutions where small-scale processes exhibit more stochastic qualities.
Small-scale convective fluctuations often interact strongly with the nonlinear flow dynamics, with substantial repercussions
for large-scale model evolution. Producing accurate and reliable probabilistic predictions therefore depends critically on
representations of parameterization uncertainties.

In the 2015 GFS implemmentaion, new stochastic physics schemes were employed to represent model error to replace
the artificial additive inflation. The upgraded stochastic physics suite has three components, including
- Stochastically Perturbed Physics Tendencies (\b SPPT; Buizza et al.(1999) \cite buizza_et_al_1999 ; Palmer (1997)
\cite palmer_1997 ; Palmer (2001) \cite palmer_2001)
- Specific HUMidity perturbations (\b SHUM; Tompkins and Berner (2008) \cite tompkins_and_berner_2008)
- Stochastic Kinetic Energy Backscatter (\b SKEB; Berner et al.(2009) \cite berner_et_al_2009; Shutts (2005) \cite shutts_2005)

All three of these schemes use a first-order auto-regrassive  (AR(1)) random pattern generator to produce spatially and temporally
correlated perturbations with three different horizontal length/time scales 500 km/0.25 days, 1000 km/3 days and 2000 km/30 days, 
and standard deviations of 0.8, 0.4 and 0.2 respectively. Zhu et al.(2018) \cite zhu_et_al_2018 show an example of a realization 
of the three components. The above nine numbers are meant to span the uncertainty at mesoscale, synoptic scale and planetary space
and time scales with pattern 1 (500 km decorrelation scale) being the starting point and most important component for the medium-range 
ensemble prediction system.

Condering the delicate balance between model dynamics and vertical momentum transport which is established in the lowest model 
levels on timescales of the order of minutes, the tendency perturbations were reduced towards zero close to the surface. A tapering
fucntion \f$\mu\f$ is applied in SPPT, so there are no tendency perturbation in the mountain blocked flow (i.e., on or below the level
of dividing streamline that is diagnosed by the gwdps_run, mountain blocking scheme). It is done to avoid numerical instability in the 
boundary layer.



\section sppt_des The SPPT Scheme in FV3GFS
ECMWF first introduced a stochastic representation of parameterization uncertainties in the medium-range ensemble in October
1998 using scheme that multiplies the total parameterized physics tendencies with a random number (Buizza et al., 1999
\cite buizza_et_al_1999). The scheme was originally referred to as 'stochastic physics'. It is now commonly referred to as the
Stochastically Perturbed Parameterization Tendency scheme (SPPT). 

The SPPT scheme in FV3GFS uses perturbations collinear to the unperturbed tendencies. For all variables \f$X\in\left\{u,v,T,q\right\}\f$,
the perturbed tendency is obtained with the same random number \f$r\f$
\f[
X_{p}=(1+r\mu)X_{c}
\f]
The distribution from which \f$r\f$ is drawn is close to a Gaussian distribution. The random field \f$r\f$ is obtained through first-order
auto-regressive processes in spectral space. At ECMWF, a multi-scale approach is implemented in IFS with 
\f[
r=\sum_{j=1}^Jr_{j}
\f]
where the component random fields \f$r_{j}\f$ are independent and represent different scales. The total physical parameterization tendency
is multiplied by a randomly-evolving global pattern field whose average value at any point is unity and whose standard deviation is prescribed.
The pattern field is composed of three independent patterns, each generated from triangularly-truncated spherical harmonic expansions which
have the property that their spatial auto-correlation function is independent of position on the sphere. Each spherical harmonic mode in each
expansion is evolved in time using first-order autogressive process with fixed decorrelation time and wavenumber-dependent noise term:
\f[
\widehat{r}_{mn}(t)=\phi\widehat{r}_{mn}(t-\Delta t)+\sigma_{n}\sqrt{1-\phi^{2}}\eta_{mn}(t)
\f]
where \f$\widehat{r}_{mn}\f$ is the spherical harmonic for zonal wave number \f$m\f$ and total wavenumber \f$n\f$,
\n \f$\sigma_{n}\f$ is the standard deviation of the time-series and is a function of \f$n\f$, decorrelation length scale, and desired
amplitude of the pattern.
\n \f$\phi\f$: temporal decorrelation
\n \f$\eta_{mn}\f$: random Gaussian number E(0,1)

\section skeb_des The Stochastic Kinetic Energy Backscatter (SKEB) scheme in FV3GFS
As with SPPT, the SKEB scheme is based on the product of a spectrally-generated pattern field and a derived model field. However,
instead of using model tendencies, the backscatter scheme uses a horizontally-smoothed dissipation rate field to modulate the pattern
field and defined this to be a streamfunction forcing function. The pattern uses a noise term with a different wavenumber dependence
to that used in SPPT and one that gives a power law spectrum
