\section des_rte_rrtmgp Description

 RTE+RRTMGP is a set of codes for computing radiative fluxes in planetary atmospheres.

 RRTMGP uses a k-distribution to provide an optical description (absorption and possibly
 Rayleigh optical depth) of the gaseous atmosphere, along with the relevant source functions,
 on a pre-determined spectral grid given temperatures, pressures, and gas concentration.
 The k-distribution currently distributed with this package is applicable to the Earth's
 atmosphere under present-day, pre-industrial, and 4xCO2 conditions.

 RTE computes fluxes given spectrally-resolved optical descriptions and source functions.
 The fluxes are normally summarized or reduced via a user extensible class.

\subsection Clear-sky-opt Clear-sky Optical Properties

 The RRTMGP LW algorithm contains 128 unevenly distributed g-points (quadrature points) in 16
 broad spectral bands, while the SW algorithm includes 112 g-points
 in 14 bands. In addition to the major atmospheric absorbing gases of
 ozone, water vapor, and carbon dioxide, the algorithm also includes
 various minor absorbing species such as methane, nitrous oxide,
 oxygen, and in the longwave up to four types of halocarbons (CFCs).

\subsection Aerosol-opt Aerosol Optical Properties

 Aerosol optical properties for	the RRTMGP bands are computed externally and provided to
 the radiation and incremented onto the gaseous optics. This is identical to how the aerosol
 optics	are included within RRTMG. There are no internal assumptions on aerosol properties
 within	the radiation scheme.

\subsection Cloud-opt Cloud Optical Properties

 Cloud optical properties are computed as a function of effective radius for the
 RRTMGP bands. Based on Mie calculations for liquid and results from Yang et al. 2013 \cite Yang_2013
 for ice with variable surface roughness.

 To represent statistically the unresolved subgrid cloud variability
 when dealing multi layered clouds, a Monte-Carlo Independent Column
 Approximation (\b McICA) method is used prior to calling the RTE.
 Several cloud overlap methods, including maximum-random, exponential,
 and exponential-random are available in both LW and SW
 radiation calculations. (\b Unlike RRTMG, in RRTMGP the subgrid sampling
 step is not within the spectral loop, but rather happens outside of
 the RTE.)
