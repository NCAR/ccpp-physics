\page GFS_SATMEDMF GFS Scale-aware TKE-based Moist Eddy-Diffusion Mass-Flux (EDMF) PBL and Free Atmospheric Turbulence Scheme
\section des_satmedmf Description

The current operational \ref GFS_HEDMF uses a hybrid EDMF parameterization for the convective PBL (Han et al. 2016 \cite Han_2016;
Han et al. 2017 \cite han_et_al_2017), where the EDMF scheme is applied only for the strongly unstable PBL, while the eddy-diffusivity
counter-gradient(EDCG) scheme is used for the weakly unstable PBL. The new TKE-EDMF is an extended version of \ref GFS_HEDMF  with below enhancement:

-# Eddy diffusivity (K) is now a function of TKE which is prognostically predicted

-# EDMF approach is applied for all the unstable PBL 

-# EDMF approach is also applied to the stratocumulus-top-driven turbulence mixing

-# It includes a moist-adiabatic process when updraft thermal becomes saturated

-# Scale-aware capability

-# It includes interaction between TKE and cumulus convection

The CCPP-compliant subroutine satmedmfvdif_run() computes subgrid vertical turbulence mixing using scale-aware
TKE-based moist eddy-diffusion mass-flux paramterization (Han et al. 2019 \cite Han_2019)
- For the convective boundary layer, the scheme adopts EDMF parameterization (Siebesma et al. (2007)\cite Siebesma_2007)
to take into account nonlocal transport by large eddies(mfpblt.f)
- A new mass-flux paramterization for stratocumulus-top-induced turbulence mixing has been introduced (mfscu.f; previously,
it was an eddy diffusion form)
- For local turbulence mixing, a TKE closure model is used.
