\section des_smkdust Smoke Scheme Description

The SRW v3.0.0 release includes the smoke modeling capability. In the model, a single aerosol tracer (smoke)
represents primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from biomass burning (BB) emissions. The BB emissions are
estimated using the fire radiative energy data from the regional ABI and VIIRS Emissions (RAVE) product
(Li et al. 2022 \cite LI2022113237), which integrates fire radiative power (FRP) data from the Geostationary 
Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-R ABI) and the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS VIIRS). The FRP data
from RAVE is used to estimate the fire heat flux in SRW to simulate the fire plume rise in the model. The SRW application
allows users to select predefined grids for smoke emission processing, and the smoke model forecast in the SRW
supports most of the predefined grids such as 25, 13 and 3 km resolution grids, which cover CONUS and North
America regions. The appropriate fixed smoke model files have been staged on Tier 1 platforms to support these forecast grids.
The model incorporates parameterizations for fire plume rise, wet and dry removal processes and radiative feedback of smoke.
Additionally, the feedback of smoke on the surface visibility diagnostics is included in the postprocessing part of the SRW 
application.

The model outputs a new fire weather index - hourly wildfire potential (HWP). The HWP index is calculated based on air 
temperature, humidity, wind speed and soil moisture (James et al., in review).

Smoke simulations can be performed for three different scenarios: (1) useing BB emissions for the same day and hour
as observed, which are estimated from satelllite observations for the current day; (2) persistence, where BB emissions
are estimated using satellite observations from the previous day; and (3) modulated persistence, where BB emissions are forecasted 
based on the HWP index simulated by the model.

The model predicts 3D BB emissions and concentrations of smoke, and other diagnostics variables such as HWP, vertically integrated
smoke and others. The following table provides full list of variables available in GRIB2 files, which are generated by the
SRW v3.0.0:

\section Fengsha_desp FENGSHA Dust Emission Scheme

Aerosols have both direct and indirect effects on meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, human health, and ultimately 
the global energy budget with dust being a major contributor to the atmospheric aerosol burden. A great effort has been
made to characterize the sources and mobilization of dust, however, current models still show large uncertainty as the 
modeling of mineral dust in the atmosphere is complex.

The FENGSHA dust emission model, implemented into the operational NOAA National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC),
and the new Global Ensemble Forecast System with Aerosols (GEFS-Aerosols), is a flexible emission model capable of predicting 
dust emissions across forecast scales.

The FENGSHA dust emission scheme, developed by NOAA ARL, simulates mineral dust emissions using a combination of theoretical frameworks 
and empirical measurements. FENGSHA builds upon the MB95 dust emission model by integrating Dale Gillette's observations,
emphasizing the role of soil characteristics - such as texture, moisture, and roughness - in determining dry threshold friction 
velocities. This scheme enhances predictions of dust aerosol concentrations, providing instrumental in applications like air quality forecasting
and climate modeling.

FENGSHA merges theoretical concepts from Marticorena and Bergametti (1995) \cite marticorena_and_bergametti_1995 with empirical data to 
model dust emissions more accurately. The main horizontal dust flux uses the Webb et al. (2020) \cite WEBB2020100560 flux equation:
\f[
 Q = C \frac{\rho_{a}}{g}(R u_{*}^3) \left ( 1 - \frac{u_{*t}^2(R,H)}{u_{*}^2} \right ) \left ( 1 + \frac{u_{*t}(R,H)}{u_{*}} \right )

\f]

- \b Threshold \b Friction \b Velocity: Soil properties control the minimum wind force required to mobilize dust particles, refined by
Gillette's empirical findings.
- \b Vertical-to-Horizontal \b Flux \b Ratio: Derived from Marticorena and Bergametti (1995) \cite marticorena_and_bergametti_1995, this
calculation links friction velocity to emission processes.
- \b Drag \b Partition \b Correction: Based on MacKinnon et al. (2004) \cite MACKINNON2004103, these adjustments account for surface
roughness influences on dust emissions.
- \b Soil \b Moisture \b Effects: Incorporates corrections from Fecan and Shao methods to adjust for the impact of soil water content. 


FENGSHA is implemented in CCPP with modular subroutines for compatibility with other atmospheric components. Key routines include:
- dust_fengsha_mod::fengsha_drag: Calculates drag partition corrections, adjusting for surface roughness effects.
- dust_fengsha_mod::dustemissionfengsha: Computes dust emissions using inputs such as soil composition, wind velocity, and air density.
- dust_fengsha_mod::moisturecorrectionfecan and dust_fengsha_mod::moisturecorrectionshao: Refines emission thresholds based on soil moisture conditions.
- dust_fengsha_mod::dustfluxv2hratiomb95: Estimates vertical-to-horizontal flux ratios using clay content and flux limits.

ensuring consistency in atmospheric simulations. FENGSHA'S modular structure allows its outputs — binned surface emissions — to integrate
smoothly into broader forecasting frameworks.


\section gen_al_smkdust FENGSHA Dust Emission General Algorithm
-# Initialize dust emissions and prepare scaling factors
-# Ensure that dust emissions do not occur over water, forests, bedrock or snow and ice
-# Apply soil moisture corrections using Fecan \cite angeo-17-149-1999 or Shao \cite shao_2004 methods 
-# Compute threshold wind friction velocity, accounting for drag partition corrections
-# Calculate horizontal saltation flux and distribute emissions across particle size bins
-# Convert emissions to mass flux, ensuring compatibility with downstream components


FENGSHA is employed in operational systems like GEFS-Aerosol(Zhang et al. 2021 \cite zhang_etal_2021) and NAQFC (Huang et al. 2025, 
Li et al., 2024), enhancing air quility and dust event predictions. It provides detailed insights into the interactions between
soil properties and atmospheric dynamics.
