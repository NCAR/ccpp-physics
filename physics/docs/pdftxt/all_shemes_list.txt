\section allscheme_overview Physics Parameterizations 

In the CCPP-Physics v3.0 release, each parameterization is in its own modern Fortran module,
 which facilitates model development and
code maintenance. While some individual parameterization can be invoked for the GMTB SCM, most users will assemble the 
parameterizations in suites.

In addition to the physical schemes themselves, this scientific documentation also covers four modules that define physics/radiation functions, parameters and constants:
 - \ref func_phys
 - \ref phy_sparam
 - \ref physcons
 - \ref radcons

The input information for the physics include the values of the gridbox mean prognostic variables (wind components, temperature,
specific humidity, cloud fraction, vater contents for cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain, snow, graupel, and ozone concentration), the provisional
 dynamical tendencies for the same variables and various surface fields, both fixed and variable.

The time integration of the GFS physics suite is based on the following:
- The tendencies from the different physical processes are computed by the parameterizations or derived in separate interstitial routines;
- The first part of the suite, comprised of the parameterizations for radiation, surface layer, surface (land, ocean, and sea ice), boundary layer,
orographic gravity wave drag, and Rayleigh damping, is computed using a hybrid of parallel and sequential splitting (Donahue and Caldwell(2018)
\cite donahue_and_caldwell_2018), a method in which the various parameterizations use the same model state as input but feel the effect of the preceding
parameterizations. The tendencies from the various parameterizations are then added together and used to update the model state.
- The second part of the physics suite, comprised of the parameterizations of ozone, stratospheric \f$H_2O\f$, deep convection, convective gravity wave drag,
shallow convection, and microphysics, is computed using sequential splitting in the order listed above, in which the model state is updated between calls
to the parameterization.

\section allsuite_overview Physics Suites
With funding from the Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS) initiative and broad support from the community NCEP/EMC recently
replaced the dynamic core in its flagship operational model, the GFS. Version 15 of the GFS (GFSv15), schedule for implementation in
middle 2019, will include the Finite-volume Cubed-Sphere (FV3) non-hydrostatic dynamic core in place of the long-running spectral Gaussian
hydrostatic core. 

The next major upgrade of the GFS is expected to be in the area of model physics.Physics upgrades are particular challenging.But community
support, enhanced collaborations, and the CCPP framework are now making it feasible to accelerate advancements in operational model physics
through wholesale replacement of individual parameterizations or even entire parameterizations suites.

Current plans call for major changes to the GFSv15 parameterization suite in anticipation of the GFSv16 implementaion, schedule for FY2021.
Several parameterizations have been identified as likely new components of the \b GFSv16 suite, including:
- The \b RRTMGP radiation parameterization, developed by Robert Pincus and colleagues, is scheduled to replace the current \ref GFS_RRTMG
- The \b Noah-MP land-surface parameterization is expected to replace the current \ref GFS_NOAH
- A unified gravity-wave-drag (\b UGWD) parameterization, developed by Valery Yudin and collaborators, will replace the separate
\ref GFS_GWDPS and \ref GFS_GWDC currently being used.
- Fresh-water lake (\b FLAKE) and multi-layer snow parameterizations will be introduced to enhance the representation of earth-atmosphere
interactions.

In addition, new parameterizations for deep and shallow moist convection (CP), cloud microphysics (MP), and planetary boundary layer (PBLP)/
turbulence are being considered. Unlike the parameterizations mentioned above, there are multiple viable options for parameterizing these
processes in GFSv16, including the schemes currently used in GFSv15. The "suite" approach is being taken for this subset of all model
parameterizations because the individual parameterizations within each candidate CP-MP-PBLP suite are highly interdependent. Thus, optimal
performance typically has been achieved within the candidate suites through collective tuning of individual parameterizations. Developers
have been invited to contribute their parameterizations as members of pre-tuned suites in hopes of optimizing performance in the GFS. This
approach is one way of "leveling the playing field" so that parameterizations developed outside the GFS framework are not unduly handicapped
by sub-optimal interactions with other GFS parameterizations.


Two suites of CP-MP-PBLP parameterizations have been identified as possible replacements for the current GFSv15 suite. \b GSD suite is
derived from the operational Rapid Refresh (RAP) and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) modeling system \cite Benjamin_2016 and was developed largely at NOAA/OAR/ESRL/GSD for mesoscale applications, while the second candidate, i.e., the \b CPT \b (Climate Process Team) suite, has components that were
developed at multiple ressearch centers and universities, including Colorado State, Utah, NASA, NCAR, and EMC. Its individual
parameterizations have been applied primarily to medium-range and longer prediction scales. For the GFSv15 suite, a very similar suite, but
with TKE-EDMF in repace of K-EDMF have been developed at EMC (Han et al. 2019 \cite Han_2019).
