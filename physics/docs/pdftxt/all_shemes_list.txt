\section allscheme_overview Physics Parameterizations 

In the CCPP-Physics v3.0 release, each parameterization is in its own modern Fortran module,
 which facilitates model development and
code maintenance. While some individual parameterization can be invoked for the GMTB SCM, most users will assemble the 
parameterizations in suites.

In addition to the physical schemes themselves, this scientific documentation also covers four modules that define physics/radiation functions, parameters and constants:
 - \ref func_phys
 - \ref phy_sparam
 - \ref physcons
 - \ref radcons

The input information for the physics include the values of the gridbox mean prognostic variables (wind components, temperature,
specific humidity, cloud fraction, water contents for cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain, snow, graupel, and ozone concentration), the provisional
 dynamical tendencies for the same variables and various surface fields, both fixed and variable.

The time integration of the physics suites is based on the following:
- The tendencies from the different physical processes are computed by the parameterizations or derived in separate interstitial routines
- The first part of the suite, comprised of the parameterizations for radiation, surface layer, surface (land, ocean, and sea ice), boundary layer,
orographic gravity wave drag, and Rayleigh damping, is computed using a hybrid of parallel and sequential splitting described in Donahue and Caldwell(2018)
\cite donahue_and_caldwell_2018, a method in which the various parameterizations use the same model state as input but are impacted by the preceding
parameterizations. The tendencies from the various parameterizations are then added together and used to update the model state.
- The surface parameterizations (land, ocean and sea ice) are invoked twice in a loop, with the first time to create a guess, and the second time to
produce the tendencies.
- The second part of the physics suite, comprised of the parameterizations of ozone, stratospheric water vapor, deep convection, convective gravity wave drag,
shallow convection, and microphysics, is computed using sequential splitting in the order listed above, in which the model state is updated between calls
to the parameterization.
- If the in-core saturation adjustment is used (\p do_sat_adj=.true.), it is invoked at shorter timesteps along with the dynamical solver.

\section allsuite_overview Physics Suites

The CCPP v3 includes the suite used in the GFS v15 implemented operationally in June 2019 (suite GFS_v15). Additionally, it includes three
developmental suites which are undergoing testing for possible future implementation in the UFS. Suite GFS_v15plus is identical to suite
GFS_v15 except for a replacement in the PBL parameterization (Han et al. 2019 \cite Han_2019 ). Suite csawmg differs from GFS_v15 as it 
contains different convection and microphysics schemes made available through a NOAA Climate Process Team (CPT) with components developed 
at multiple research centers and universities, including Colorado State, Utah, NASA, NCAR, and EMC. Suite GSD_v0 differs from GFS_v15 as it 
uses the convection, microphysics, and boundary layer schemes employed in the Rapid Refresh (RAP) and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR \cite Benjamin_2016 )
operational models and was assembled by NOAA/GSD. An assessment of an earlier version of these suites can be found in 
<a href="https://ufscommunity.org/#/science/physics"> the UFS portal </a>
and in <a href="https://dtcenter.org/eval/gmtb/phytest2019/"> the GMTB website </a> .
