\section gsd_mynn_edmf_nml  GSD MYNN-EDMF Namelist Option 

\param bl_mynn_mixlength  0: Original form from Nakanishi and Niino (2009) \cite NAKANISHI_2009. No scale-wareness is applied to the master mixing length, regardless of "scaleware" setting.
\n                        1: HRRR operational form 201609-201807. Designed to work without the mass-flux scheme.Uses BouLac mixing length in free atmosphere. This helps remove excessively large mixing in unstable layers aloft. Scale-awareness in dx is available via "scaleaware" setting.
\n                        2: HRRR operational form 201807-present. Designed to be compatible with mass-flux scheme activated (default). as in (1), but \e elb is lengthened using separate cloud mixing length functions for statistically stable and unstable regimes. This 
\e elb adjustment is only possible for nonzero cloud fractions, such that cloud-free cells are treated as in (1), but BouLac calculation is used more sparingly when \e elb > 500 m. This is to reduce the computational expense that comes with the BouLac calculation. Also,
This option is scale-aware in dx if "scaleaware" =1. (Following Ito et al. 2015 \cite Ito_2015)
