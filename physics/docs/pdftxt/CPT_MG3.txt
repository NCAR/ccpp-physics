\section des_MG3_cloud Description
MG3 microphysics (MP) scheme is a six-category double momentum bulk scheme. It forecasts mass of ten 
hydrometeors (cloud water, cloud ice, rain, snow and graupel) and their number concentrations in addition to mass of water vapor.
Physics processes of MG3 cloud MP are described in Figure 1. 

# Morrison Gettelman Advancements
- MG1: Morrison and Gettelman (2008) \cite Morrison_2008 (CESM1, CAM5) 
  - Morrison et al 2005 scheme
  - Added sub-grid scale variance
  - Coupling to activation (aerosols)
- MG2: Gettelman and Morrison (2015) \cite Gettelman_2015_1 \cite Gettelman_2015_2 (CESM2, CAM6)
  - Prognostic precipitation (rain and snow)
  - Sub-stepping and sub-column capable
- MG3: Gettelman et al. 2019 (accepted by JAMES)
  - Rimed hydrometeors (graupel or hail) are added to stratiform cloud scheme for global models.
  - Global climate impacts are limited to small increased in ice mass.
  - High (14 km) resolution similations show local production of rimed ice (graupel) can affect regional precipitation amounts and intensity.

A schematic of the MG3 scheme is shown in Figure 1. MG3 starts with MG2 \cite Gettelman_2015_1 \cite Gettelman_2015_2 and adds a 
series of processes (in red). One rimed hydrometeor category is added. Both mass and number are prognosed. Rimed ice has the 
"character" of hail or graupel by pre-selecting density and fall speed paramters.

Some unique attributes of MG3 cloud microphysics include:

-# Consistent treatment of cloud fraction in cloud macrophysics and radiation
-# Subgrid-scale microphysics
-# Max-overlap and in-cloud precipitation fraction area
-# Options for subcolumn microphysics
-# Options to run MG2 using the same code as MG3
-# Options to run MG1 
-# Completely aerosol awareness with 1) 1) constant aerosol mixing ratio, 2) climatology IN/CCN from CAM5,  3) climatology aerosol from MERRA2 , 4) GOCART, and  5) MAM7
-# Options to call fast physics as GFDL microphysics
-# Number concentration of all species forcasted and has local storage
-# Sub-step semi-implicit sedimentation
