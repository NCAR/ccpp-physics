\section des_MG3_cloud Description
The Morrison-Gettelman Version 3  (MG3) microphysics scheme is a six-category double momentum bulk scheme. It forecasts mass 
and number concentration of five hydrometeors (cloud water, cloud ice, rain, snow and graupel) in addition to mass of water vapor.

# Morrison Gettelman Advancements
- MG1: Morrison and Gettelman (2008) \cite Morrison_2008 (CESM1, CAM5) 
  - Morrison et al 2005 scheme
  - Added sub-grid scale variance
  - Coupling to activation (aerosols)
- MG2: Gettelman and Morrison (2015) \cite Gettelman_2015_1 \cite Gettelman_2015_2 (CESM2, CAM6)
  - Prognostic precipitation (rain and snow)
  - Sub-stepping and sub-column capable
- MG3: Gettelman et al. (2019) \cite Gettelman_et_al_2019
  - Rimed hydrometeors (graupel or hail) are added to stratiform cloud scheme for global models
  - Global climate impacts are limited to small increased in ice mass
  - High (14 km) resolution simulations show local production of rimed ice (graupel) can affect regional 
precipitation amounts and intensity

A schematic of the MG3 scheme is shown in Figure 1. MG3 starts with MG2 \cite Gettelman_2015_1 \cite Gettelman_2015_2 and adds a 
series of processes (in red). One rimed hydrometeor category is added. Both mass and number are prognosed. Rimed ice has the 
"character" of hail or graupel by pre-selecting density and fall speed parameters.

Some unique attributes of MG3 cloud microphysics include:

-# Consistent treatment of cloud fraction in cloud macrophysics and radiation
-# Subgrid-scale microphysics
-# Maximum-overlap and in-cloud precipitation fraction area
-# Options for subcolumn microphysics
-# Options for running with fewer species and processes, simulating MG1 and MG2 codes
-# Completely aerosol awareness with 1) constant aerosol mixing ratio, 2) climatology IN/CCN from CAM5 (default; \c cam5_4_143_NAAI_monclimo2.nc),  3) climatology aerosol from MERRA2 , 4) GOCART, and  5) MAM7
-# Sub-step semi-implicit sedimentation
-# Can be used along with the FV in-core saturation adjustment
