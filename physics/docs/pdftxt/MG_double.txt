/**
\page MG_double Morrison-Gettleman Microphysics Scheme
\section mg_descri  Description

- Based on MG microphysics from GMAO, with an option to predict rain, snow, and their number concentration (added at EMC) 
- Takes into account the detrained condensates from RAS, CSAW, or any other convective parameterizations.
- Couples with either GMAO macrophysics or SHOC (needs some work)
- Couples with prognostic GOCART via internal tracers
- Can use "prescribed" GOCART aerosols via external files, either GEOS-4 GOCART monthly climatology or NGAC output or
MERRA2 aerosol reanalysis (proposed) for an affordable approach.
- Included in IPDv4
