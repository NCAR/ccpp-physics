/**
\page subpage_overview Overview of the Code

In the CCPP-Physics v2 code, each parameterization is placed in its own modern Fortran module, which facilitates model development and
code maintenance. While some individual parameterization can be invoked for CCPP SCM, most users will assemble the 
parameterizations in suites. The parameterizations contained in CCPP-Physics v2 can be used to run two suites: FV3GFS default
(with GFDL cloud microphysics) and GFS with Zhao-Carr microphysics. 

The FV3GFS physics suite uses the parameterizations in the following order, as defined in  \c suite_SCM_GFS_2017_updated.xml and
\c suite_SCM_GFS_2018_updated.xml:
 + @ref GFS_RRTMG
 + @ref GFS_SFCLYR
 + @ref GFS_NSST
 + @ref GFS_NOAH
 + @ref GFS_SFCSICE
 + @ref GFS_HEDMF
 + @ref GFS_GWDPS
 + @ref GFS_RAYLEIGH
 + @ref GFS_OZPHYS
 + @ref GFS_H2OPHYS
 + @ref GFS_SAMFdeep
 + @ref GFS_GWDC
 + @ref GFS_SAMFshal
 + GFS Microphysics (MP) scheme option:
   + @ref GFDL_cloud 
     + @ref gfdlmp
     + @ref fast_sat_adj
   + @ref GFS_ZHAOC
     + @ref condense
     + @ref precip
 + @ref GFS_CALPRECIPTYPE

The parameterizations included in the CCPP-Physics v2 are all column-based, that is, computations are performed only in the vertical.
The input information for the physics include the values of the gridbox mean prognostic variables (wind components, temperature,
specific humidity, cloud fraction, vater contents for cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain, snow, graupel, and ozone concentration), the provisional
 dynamical tendencies for the same variables and various surface fields, both fixed and variable.

The time integration of the GFS physics suite is based on the following:
- The tendencies from the different physical processes are computed by the parameterizations or derived in separate interstitial routines; 
- The first part of the suite, comprised of the parameterizations for radiation, surface layer, surface (land, ocean, and sea ice), boundary layer,
orographic gravity wave drag, and Rayleigh damping, is computed using a hybrid of parallel and sequential splitting (Donahue and Caldwell(2018)
\cite donahue_and_caldwell_2018), a method in which the various parameterizations use the same model state as input but feel the effect of the preceding
parameterizations. The tendencies from the various parameterizations are then added together and used to update the model state.
- The second part of the physics suite, comprised of the parameterizations of ozone, stratospheric \f$H_2O\f$, deep convection, convective gravity wave drag,
shallow convection, and microphysics, is computed using sequential splitting in the order listed above, in which the model state is updated between calls
to the parameterization.

In addition to the physical schemes themselves, this scientific documentation also covers four modules that define physics/radiation functions, parameters and constants:
 + @ref func_phys
 + @ref phy_sparam
 + @ref physcons
 + @ref radcons
