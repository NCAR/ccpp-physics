\section des_sfcpert Description

Land surface perturbation (Gehne et al. (2019) \cite Gehne_2019) has been recently introduced 
into FV3GFS. This treatment is based on the hypothesis that one of the major
causes of the insufficient spread in current global NWP model,especially near the surface, is a lack of treatment of 
uncertainty in the soil state and in the associated model parameters. It allows for land surface parameters such as surface albedo,
vegetation fraction, soil hydraulic conductivity, leaf area index (LAI), surface roughness lengths for heat and momentom to vary in space.
These parameters and variables have been shown to impact forecasts of 2m temperature, 10m wind and precipitation. Based on the parameter
or variable,different strategies to perturb are necessary.

Table 1 presents a summary of the uncertainty or range of values associated with the parameters and variables that are considered.

\section table Uncertainty or range of values identified for the perturbed parameters (Gehne et al. (2019))
|     Parameter or variable         |  Estimated uncertainty or range       |   Reference                        |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|      Albedo                       |  2\%-12\% of Albedo                   | Grant et al. (2000) \cite grant_et_al_2000 ; Qu and Hall (2005) \cite qu_and_hall_2005 |
| Vegetation fraction               |  20\%-30\% of Vegetation fraction     | Computed from MODIS vegetation fraction data                                           |
| Momentum roughness length        





Momentum roughness length (\f$Z_{0}\f$),heat/momentum roughness length ratio (\f$Z_{t}/Z_{0}\f$),

Albedo and vegetation fraction perturbation are applied by percentile matching of the normal distribution with the beta distribution
(i.e. cdfnor() and ppfbet()). This is to ensure that the perturbed values are contained within the interval [0,1]. The size of the 
perturbations is based on observational estimates of the uncertainty in albedo and vegetation.

- Another possible reason for current GEFS under-spread near the surface is that initial conditions do not reflect the un
