\section RRFS_v1_suite_overview Overview

The HRRR_gf suite is one of the candidates for the future operational implementation of
the Rapid Refresh Forecast System (RRFS). Simplified configurations of RRFS can be configured using
the UFS SRW App. This suite is similar to the one used by the NOAA operational HRRR v4 (Dowell et al. 2022 \cite Dowell_2022), 
with the addition of the Grell-Freitas deep convective parameterization.  

While the parameterization for smoke and dust representation is used RRFS prototype tests and is included in the 
HRRR_gf Suite Definition File, is not active in the CCPP Single Column Model since the smoke and dust tracers are initialized 
with new zero values.

The HRRR_gf suite uses the parameterizations in the following order:
 - \ref SGSCLOUD_page
 - \ref GFS_RRTMG_page
 - \ref SFC_MYNNSFL
 - \ref RUCLSM
 - \ref CLM_LAKE_page
 - \ref MYNNEDMF
 - \ref GFS_drag_suite
 - \ref GFS_H2OPHYS
 - \ref CU_GF
