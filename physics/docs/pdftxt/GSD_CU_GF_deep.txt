\section gfcu_descrip  Description

The Rapid Refresh (RAP) uses the Grell-Freitas (GF) convective scheme, while the HRRR allows direct prediction
of convection at its 3-km horizontal scale. In the RAP, the Grell-Freitas parameterization removes convective
instability so that the gridscale precipitation scheme does not "convect", convective precipitation is a scheme
byproduct. Grell-Freitas is an Arakawa-Schubert mass flux type scheme, and is both aerosol and model scale aware.
Aerosol awareness (emulating the impact of aerosols on precipitation processes) is obtained through changing the rate of 
converstion from cloud droplets to raindrops (Berry 1968 \cite berry_1968 ), and by modifying the precipitation efficiency of the 
raindrops (the fraction of total condensed water volume in the cloud's lifetime reaching the ground (Jiang et al.(2010) \cite Jiang_2010) )
Scale awareness comes through the use of an empirical formula for the fractional area (\f$\sigma\f$) of the model grid column
containing updrafts and downdrafts (Arakawa et al. (2011) \cite Arakawa_2011 ). The entrainment rate for the updrafts is an inverse function
of \f$\sigma\f$. As the fractional coverage become large, the resolved motion takes over convective processes (why the HRRR is called 
"convection allowing") and the Grell-Freitas scheme becomes a shallow convection scheme, simulating the effects of unresolved fair weather 
and towering cumulus on the forecast variables.

The GF scheme still uses an ensemble of convective schemes, but is now limited to options that modulate closure and capping
inversion thresholds for convection. After calculations for each member of the cloud ensemble in the convective scheme, the ensemble 
mean time tendency for temperature, moisture, and cloud and precipitation hydrometeors is passed to the rest of the model 
(Grell and \f$D\acute{e}v\acute{e}nyi\f$, 2002 \cite Grell_2002 ). Additionally, the upward mass flux from parameterized convective updrafts is balanced by
subsidence in adjacent grid columns, if horizontal resolution of the model using the parameterization is less than 10 km.

# Operational Impacts in RAP/HRRR

  - Uses mass-flux schemes, which are more physically realistic than (sounding) adjustment schemes
  - Takes parameterization uncertainty into account by using multiple convective schemes, using variations on scheme parameters
  - For higher resolutions (less than 10 km), transitions as grid spacing decreases into a shallow convection scheme, as the grid scale motions begin to handle convective processes. This makes the scheme "scale aware".
  - Scheme is aerosol-aware, driven by aerosol relationship to concentration of condensation nuclei.
  - Coupled to the grid scale precipitation and radiation schemes through passing of diagnosed cloud liquid and ice from simulated
precipitating convective cloud and shallow convective clouds,


\section intra_rough_gf Intraphysics Communication
The GF scheme passes cloud hydrometeors to the grid-scale microphysics scheme (\ref GSD_THOMPSON ) through detrainment from each 
convective cloud layer containing convective cloud. The detrained condensate interacts with short- and longwave radiation by 
contributing to the "opaqueness" to radiation of each grid layer. Additionally, detrained condensate is added to any existing condensate,
to be treated by the complex grid-scale microphysics scheme. This allows for a crude emulation of stratiform precipitation regions
in the RAP.

Additionally, the shallow convection and PBL schemes pass cloud information to the radiation scheme, which improved cloud/radiation
interaction and retention of the inversion typically found above mixed layers.
