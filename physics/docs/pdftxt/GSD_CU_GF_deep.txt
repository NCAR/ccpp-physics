\section gfcu_descrip  Description

The Grell-Freitas (GF) scheme as described in Grell and Freitas (2014, GF1) \cite grell_and_freitas_2014 and 
Freitas et al. (2018, FG) \cite freitas_et_al_2018 follow the mass flux approach published by Grell (1993) \cite grell_1993.
Further developments by Grell and \f$D\acute{e}v\acute{e}nyi\f$ (2002) \cite Grell_2002 included implementing 
stochastics through allowing parameter perturbations. In GF1 scale awareness, and the aerosol dependence through rain generation (following
Berry (1968) \cite berry_1968 and evaporation formulations (following Jiang et al. (2010) \cite Jiang_2010 ), depending on the 
cloud concentration nuclei at cloud base were added. FG included mixed phase physics impact, momentum transport (as in ECMWF),
 a diurnal cycle closure (Bechtold et al. (2014) \cite bechtold_et_al_2014 ), and a trimodal spectral size to simulate the interaction
and transition from shallow, congestus and deep convection regimes. The vertical massflux distribution of shallow, congestus and
deep convection regimes is characterized by Probability Density Functions (PDF's). The three PDF's are meant to represent the average
statistical mass flux characteristic of deep, congestus, and shallow (respectively) plumes in the grid area. Each PDF therefore represents
a spectrum of plumes within the grid box. Forcing is different for each characteristic type. Entrainment and detrainment are derived 
from the PDF's. The deep convection considers scale awareness (Arakawa et al. (2011) \cite Arakawa_2011 ), the congestus type convection 
as well as the shallow convection are not scale-aware. Aerosol dependence is implemented through dependence of rain generation and 
evaporation formulations depending on the cloud concentration nuclei at cloud base. Aerosol dependence is considered experimental and 
is turned off at this point. GF is able to transport tracers.

A paper describing the latest changes and modifications is in progress and will be submitted to GMD.

\b Operational \b Impacts \b in \b RAP/HRRR

  - Uses mass-flux schemes, which are more physically realistic than (sounding) adjustment schemes
  - Takes parameterization uncertainty into account by allowing parameters from multiple convective schemes which can be perturbed 
internally or with temporal and spatial correlation patterns
  - For higher resolutions (less than 10 km), in addition to scale awareness as in Arakawa et al. (2011) \cite Arakawa_2011 GF can
transition as grid spacing decreases into a shallow convection scheme
  - Coupled to the grid scale precipitation and radiation schemes through passing of diagnosed cloud liquid and ice from simulated
precipitating convective cloud and shallow convective clouds

\section intra_rough_gf Intraphysics Communication
The GF scheme passes cloud hydrometeors to the grid-scale microphysics scheme (\ref GSD_THOMPSON ) through detrainment from each 
convective cloud layer containing convective cloud. The detrained condensate interacts with short- and longwave radiation by 
contributing to the "opaqueness" to radiation of each grid layer. Additionally, detrained condensate is added to any existing condensate,
to be treated by the complex grid-scale microphysics scheme. This allows for a crude emulation of stratiform precipitation regions
in the RAP.

Additionally, the shallow convection and PBL schemes pass cloud information to the radiation scheme, which improved cloud/radiation
interaction and retention of the inversion typically found above mixed layers.
