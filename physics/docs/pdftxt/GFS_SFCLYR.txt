\section des_rough  Description

 The lowest model layer is assumed to be the surface layer and apply the 
 Monin-Obukhov similarity profile relationship to obtain the surface stress
 and sensible and latent heat fluxes. The formulation was based on 
 Miyakoda and Sirutis (1986) \cite miyakoda_and_sirutis_1986
 and has been modified by P. Long \cite long_1984 \cite long_1986 
in the very stable and very unstable situations.

 \ref Noah_LSM are largely responsible for the quality
 of model forecasts produced for near-surface weather parameters, such
 as 2-meter air temperature (\f$T_{2m}\f$) and surface skin temperature
  (\f$LST\f$). \f$LST\f$ is derived from the surface energy budget, and is
 particularly important to remote sensing and data  assimilation. How
 precise these two parameters can be simulated by the model strongly
 depends on how accurate the surface heat fluxes are parameterized,
 particularly the surface sensible heat flux (\f$SH\f$). The surface
 thermal roughness length is a key parameter to determine \f$SH\f$.
 Previous GFS version do not distinguish between the roughness length
 for heat and momentum. The aerodynamic roughness \f$Z_{0m}\f$ is used
 for wind, while the thermal roughness \f$Z_{0t}\f$ is used for heat and
 water vapor. In the surface layer, the GFS applies the MO similarity profile
 scheme with modified stability functions (Miyakoda and Sirutis 1986 \cite miyakoda_and_sirutis_1986;
 Long 1984, 1986 \cite long_1984 \cite long_1986).
 Momentum and thermal roughness lengths are necessary to estimate the 
 surface fluxes from the atmospheric surface layer similarity theory. In the current
 operational GFS, the momentum roughtness length \f$Z_{0m}\f$ is specified according to the 
 fixed vegetation types but has no seasonal variation.

 In May 2011, the new vegetation-dependent formulations of
 thermal roughness formulation ( 
 Zheng et al. (2012) \cite zheng_et_al_2012)
 was implemented to deal with the cold \f$LST\f$ bias
 over the arid western continental United States
  (CONUS) during daytime. The thermal roughness length \f$Z_{0H}\f$ is derived by a 
 seasonlly varying formulation dependent on the seasonal cycle of green vegetation
 fraction. In this \f$Z_{0H}\f$ formulation, a key parameter known as \f$C_{zil}\f$
 is specified according to a dependence on canopy height.

The NCEP GFS global prediction model has experienced a longstanding problem of severe 
cold bias in the \f$T_{2m}\f$ forecasts over land in the late afternoon and nighttime
during moist seasons. This cold bias is closely associated with the nocturnal stable 
boundary layer and is accompanied by a corresponding warm air temperature bias in the first
model level above the ground. In 2017, Zheng et al. (2017) \cite zheng_et_al_2017 identified the 
bias and introduced a stability parameter constraint \f$(z/L)_{lim}\f$ to prevent the land-atmosphere system from fully decoupling:
\f[
(z/L)_{lim}=\frac{ln(\frac{z}{z_{0M}})}{2\alpha(1-\frac{z_{0M}}{z})}
\f]

Here \f$z\f$ is the height, \f$L\f$ is the Obukhov length, \f$z_{0M}\f$ is the momentum roughness length, and \f$\alpha = 5\f$. 

The pertinent features of the GFS stable surface layer parameterization scheme are described in the appendix of Zheng et al. (2017) 
\cite zheng_et_al_2017.
