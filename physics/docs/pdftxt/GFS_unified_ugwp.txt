\section des_uugwp Description

The "unified_ugwp" scheme was the first "unification" of the  \ref GFS_drag_suite with the \ref GFS_UGWP_v0 orographic and 
non-stationary gravity wave drag schemes.  It was coded as a testing platform
 to determine the optimal combination of schemes to use for future physics 
prototypes.  For the large-scale orographic GWD and blocking scheme, the user 
may specify either those of the \ref GFS_UGWP_v0 or those of the \ref GFS_drag_suite. 
The GSL Drag Suite includes two new "small-scale" orographic drag schemes, which 
may be used in combination with either "large-scale" orographic schemes. 
Finally, the non-stationary GWD scheme is that of the \ref GFS_UGWP_v0 scheme.

\b Description \b of \b the \b GSL \b Drag \b Suite:

The \ref GFS_drag_suite, developed by NOAA's Global Systems Laboratory, 
is a set of subgrid-scale orographic drag parameterizations that 
calculate momentum tendencies due to the effects of unresolved topography.
The drag forces they represent are those due to: 1) large-scale gravity 
(mountain) waves that propagate vertically and break in the free atmosphere
of the troposphere, stratosphere and above; 2) low-level flow blocking; 
3) small-scale gravity wave drag (GWD) due to mountain waves generated 
in stable planetary boundary layer (PBL) conditions, typically at nighttime, 
which break at or near the PBL top; and 4) turbulent orographic form drag 
(TOFD), which is generated by turbulent pressure perturbations that are 
correlated with the terrain slope.  The distinction between the large-scale 
and small-scale gravity waves is that the former are generated by topography
 with horizontal scales on the order of 5 km and greater, which can support 
vertical propagation through the typical static stabilities found in the 
free atmosphere, while the latter are generated by topography with smaller 
horizontal scales down to about 1 km, which can support vertical propagation 
only in very stable conditions, typically found in nocturnal PBLs.

The large-scale GWD scheme is based on Kim and Doyle (2005)\cite kim_and_doyle_2005 and 
Choi and Hong (2015) \cite choi_and_hong_2015 and the code originated from the NCAR Weather 
Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and NOAA RAP/HRRR.  The low-level 
blocking scheme is adapted from Kim and Doyle (2005) \cite kim_and_doyle_2005, with the code 
also originating from the WRF and RAP/HRRR.  The small-scale orographic 
GWD scheme is based on Steeneveld et al (2008) \cite steeneveld_et_al_2008 and 
Tsiringakis et al. (2017) \cite tsiringakis_et_al_2017, and the TOFD scheme is adapted from 
Beljaars et al. (2004) \cite beljaars_et_al_2004.

All four orographic GWD schemes require static input data files that 
contain statistical information about the subgrid terrain within each 
model grid cell, such as the standard deviation of the subgrid topography, 
which comes from the high resolution USGS 30-second GMETED2010 dataset.  
These data files augment the usual "oro_data.tile*.nc" files, which contain 
orographic height data and GWD static data for the GFSv16 GWD parameterizations. 
The static data files for the large-scale GWD and blocking schemes are named 
"oro_data_ls.tile*.nc".  The source topography for the datasets are calculated 
from a 2.5-minute lat-lon grid to filter out small-scale topographic variations. 
The static data files for the small-scale GWD and TOFD schemes are named 
"oro_data_ss.tile*.nc".  The data is from the 30-second topographic dataset, 
but band-passed filtered from approximately 20 km down to approximately 2 km 
as per Beljaars et al. (2004)\cite beljaars_et_al_2004.

The large-scale GWD and blocking schemes are explicitly tapered off from 
horizontal grid resolutions starting at approximately 13 km down to approximately 
3 km resolution, at and below which the scheme is not active.

\b Description \b of \b the \b non-stationary \b GWD \b scheme \b of \b the \ref GFS_UGWP_v0 \b scheme:

The NGW physics scheme parameterizes the effects of non-stationary waves 
unresolved by dynamical cores. These non-stationary oscillations with periods 
bounded by Coriolis and Brunt-Väisälä frequencies and typical horizontal 
scales from tens to several hundreds of kilometers,  are forced by the 
imbalance of convective and frontal/jet dynamics in the troposphere and 
lower stratosphere (Fritts (1984) \cite fritts_1984; 
Alexander et al.(2010) \cite alexander_et_al_2010; 
Plougonven and Zhang 2014 \cite plougonven_and_zhang_2014). The NGWs propagate 
upwards and the amplitudes exponentially grow with altitude until instability 
and breaking of waves occur. Convective and dynamical instability induced 
by GWs with large amplitudes can trigger production of small-scale turbulence 
and self-destruction of waves. The latter process in the theory of atmospheric 
GWs is frequently referred as the wave saturation (Lindzen(1981) \cite lindzen_1981; 
Weinstock(1984) \cite weinstock_1984; Fritts(1984) \cite fritts_1984). 
Herein, “saturation” or "breaking" refers to any processes that act to reduce 
wave amplitudes due to instabilities and/or interactions arising from 
large-amplitude perturbations limiting the exponential growth of GWs with height. 
Background dissipation processes such as molecular diffusion and radiative cooling, 
in contrast, act independently of GW amplitudes. In the middle atmosphere, 
impacts of NGW saturation (or breaking) and dissipation on the large-scale 
circulation, mixing, and transport have been acknowledged in the physics 
of global weather and climate models after pioneering studies by 
Lindzen(1981) \cite lindzen_1981 and Holton(1983) \cite holton_1983. 
Comprehensive reviews on the physics of NGWs and OGWs in climate and 
weather models have been discussted in Alexander et al. 2010 \cite alexander_et_al_2010, 
Geller et al. 2013 \cite geller_et_al_2013, and Garcia et al. 2017 \cite garcia_et_al_2017. 
They are formulated using different aspects of the nonlinear and 
linear propagation, instability, breaking and dissipation of waves 
along with different specifications of GW sources 
(Garcia et al. 2007 \cite garcia_et_al_2007; 
Richter et al 2010 \cite richter_et_al_2010; 
Eckermann et al. 2009 \cite eckermann_et_al_2009; 
Eckermann 2011 \cite eckermann_2011; 
Lott et al. 2012 \cite lott_et_al_2012).

The concept of UGWP was first proposed and implemented in 
the Unified Forecast System (UFS) with model top at different levels 
by scientists from the University of Colorado Cooperative Institute for 
Research in the Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at NOAA's Space Weather 
Prediction Center (SWPC) and from NOAA's Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) 
(Alpert et al. 2019 \cite alpert_et_al_2019; Yudin et al. 2016 \cite yudin_et_al_2016; 
Yudin et al. 2018 \cite yudin_et_al_2018). The UGWP considers identical 
GW propagation solvers for OGWs and NGWs with different approaches for 
specification of subgrid wave sources. The current set of the input and 
control parameters for UGWP version 0 (UGWP v0) enables options for GW effects, 
including momentum deposition (also called GW drag), heat deposition, and mixing 
by eddy viscosity, conductivity and diffusion; however, note that the eddy 
mixing effects induced by instability of GWs are not activated in this version.

Namelist parameters control the number of directional azimuths in which 
waves can propagate, number of waves in a single direction, and the level 
above the surface at which NGWs can be launched. Among the input parameters, 
the GW efficiency factors reflect intermittency of wave excitation. They 
should vary with horizontal resolution, reflecting the capability of the 
dynamical core to resolve mesoscale wave activity with the enhancement 
of model resolution.

Prescribed distributions for vertical momentum flux (VMF) of NGWs have 
been employed in global numerical weather prediction and reanalysis models 
to ease tuning of GW schemes to the climatology of the middle atmosphere 
dynamics in the absence of the global wind data above about 35 km 
(Eckermann et al. 2009 \cite eckermann_et_al_2009; Molod et al. 2015 \cite molod_et_al_2015). 
These distributions of VMF qualitatively describe the general features 
of the latitudinal and seasonal  variations of the global GW activity in 
the lower stratosphere, observed from the ground and space 
(Ern et al. 2018 \cite ern_et_al_2018). Subgrid GW sources can also be 
parameterized to respond to year-to-year variations of solar input and 
anthropogenic emissions (Richter et al 2010 \cite richter_et_al_2010; 
2014 \cite richter_et_al_2014).

Note that in UGWP v0, the momentum and heat deposition due to GW breaking and dissipation have been tested in the multi-year simulations and medium-range forecasts using a configuration of the UFS weather model using 127 levels with model top at approximately 80 km. 

Along with the GW heat and momentum depositions, GW eddy mixing is an 
important element of the Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM) physics, as shown 
in WAM simulations with the spectral dynamics (Yudin et al. 2018 \cite yudin_et_al_2018). 
The impact of eddy mixing effects in the middle and upper atmosphere, 
which is not included in this version, need to be tested, evaluated, 
and orchestrated with the representation of the subgrid turbulent diffusion 
and the numerical dissipation.

The representation of subgrid GWs is particularly important for WAMs that 
extend into the thermosphere (top lid at about 600 km). In the mesosphere and 
thermosphere, the background attenuation of subgrid waves due to molecular 
and turbulent diffusion, radiative damping and ion drag will be the 
additional mechanism of NGW and OGW dissipation along with convective and 
dynamical instability of waves described by the linear (Lindzen 1981 \cite lindzen_1981) 
and nonlinear (Weinstock 1984 \cite weinstock_1984; 
Hines 1997 \cite hines_1997) saturation theories.
