\section ruclsm_descrip Description

The land surface model (LSM) was originally developed as part of the NOAA Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) model development effort; with ongoing modifications, it is now used as an option for the WRF community model. The RUC model and its WRF-based NOAA successor, the Rapid Refresh (RAP) and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), are hourly updated and have an emphasis on short-range, near-surface forecasts including aviation-impact variables and pre-convective environment. Therefore, coupling to this LSM (hereafter the RUC LSM) has been critical to provide more accurate lower boundary conditions. 

The RUC LSM became operational at the NOAA/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) first, as part of the RUC from 1998–2012, and then 
as part of the RAP from 2012 through the present and as part of HRRR from 2014 through the present. The simple treatments of basic land surface 
processes in the RUC LSM (Smirnova et al. 2016 \cite Smirnova_2016 ) have proven to be physically robust and capable of realistically representing 
the evolution of soil moisture, soil temperature, and snow in cycled models. Extension of the RAP domain to encompass all of North America and 
adjacent high-latitude ocean areas necessitated further development of the RUC LSM for application in the tundra permafrost regions and over Arctic 
sea ice (Smirnova et al. 2000 \cite Smirnova_2000). Other modifications include refinements in the snow model and a more accurate specification of 
albedo, roughness length, and other surface properties. These recent modifications in the RUC LSM are described and evaluated in 
Smirnova et al. 2016 \cite Smirnova_2016 .

The parameterizations in the RUC LSM describe complicated atmosphere–land surface interactions in an intentionally simplified fashion to avoid 
excessive sensitivity to multiple uncertain surface parameters. Nevertheless, the RUC LSM, when coupled with the hourly-assimilating atmospheric model, 
demonstrated over years of ongoing cycling (Benjamin et al. 2004a,b \cite Benjamin_2004a \cite Benjamin_2004b ; Berbery et al. 1999 \cite Berbery_1999) 
that it can produce a realistic evolution of hydrologic and time-varying soil fields (i.e., soil moisture and temperature) that cannot be directly 
observed over large areas, as well as the evolution of snow  cover on the ground surface. This result is possible only if the soil–vegetation–snow 
component of the coupled model, constrained only by atmospheric boundary conditions and the specification of surface characteristics, has sufficient 
skill to avoid long-term drift.

International projects for intercomparison of land surface and snow parameterization schemes were essential in providing the testing environment and 
afforded an excellent opportunity to evaluate the RUC LSM with different land use and soil types and within a variety of climates. The RUC LSM was 
included in phase 2(d) of the Project for the Intercomparison of Land Surface Prediction Schemes [PILPS-2(d)], in which tested models performed 
18-yr simulations of the land surface state for the Valdai site in Russia (Schlosser et al. 1997 \cite Schlosser_1997 ; Slater et al. 2001 \cite Slater_2001 ; 
Luo et al. 2003 \cite Luo_2003 ). The RUC LSM was also tested during the Snow Models Intercomparison Project (SnowMIP, SnowMIP2, ESM-SnowMIP), 
with emphasis on snow parameterizations for both grassland and forest locations in different parts of the world 
(Etchevers et al. 2002, 2004 \cite Etchevers_2002 \cite Etchevers_2004; Essery et al. 2009 \cite Essery_2009 ; Rutter et al. 2009 \cite Rutter_2009 , 
Krinner et al. 2018 \cite Krinner_2018 ). The analysis of RUC LSM performance over 10 reference sites in ESM-SnowMIP rated it on the 5th place 
among the 26 participating models.

In global application, RUC LSM is implemented in the Global Systems Division (GSD) physics suite for testing in the NOAA Next-Generation Global
Prediction System (NGGPS)- FV3-GSD suite. To specify surface characteristics, RUC LSM uses the Land Data Sets provided by NCEP for Global
Modeling Systems (see Figure 2 in \ref GFS_NOAH )

## RUC LSM characteristics that differ from NOAH LSM:
\image html ruc_lsm_veg_soil.png "Figure 1. RUC LSM Vegetation and Soil Model (Courtesy of T.G. Smirnova) " width=10cm
- \b Implicit \b solution of energy and moisture budgets in the layer spanning the ground surface
- \b 9 \b soil \b levels with high vertical resolution near surface
RUC LSM has more levels in oil than \ref GFS_NOAH model with higher resolution near the interface with the atmosphere
- \b Prognostic \b soil moisture variable (\f$\theta-\theta_r\f$)
The prognostic variables for soil moisture is volumetric soil moisture content minus residual value of soil moisture which is tied
to soil particles and does not participate in moisture transport.
- \b Frozen \b soil \b physics algorithm
RUC LSM has a different approach to take into account freezing and thawing processes in soil.
- Treatment of \b mixed \b phase \b precipitation
It accounts for mixed phase precipitation provided by \ref THOMPSON used in RAP and HRRR.
- Simple treatment of \b sea \c ice which solves heat diffusion in sea ice and allows evolving snow cover on top of sea ice
- sub-grid-scale \b heterogeneity of surface parameters in RUC LSM
With the certain level of confidence in the skill of the model, the next requirement is to provide land static fields and surface 
parameters with the best possible accuracy. RAP and HRRR use the same datasets as \ref GFS_NOAH. But instead of specifying surface
parameters for the dominant soil and land-use category in the grid box, RUC LSM takes into account the sub-grid scale heterogeneity
in the computation of such parameters as roughness length, emissivity, soil porosity, soil heat capacity and others. The difference in
roughness between the mosaic and dominant category presented on figure 2 is positive from contribution of the forests, which helped to 
reduce high biases of surface wind speeds in these regions. Roughness lenghth has also seasonal variability in the cropland regions,
which again helped to improve the wind forecasts during the warm season.

- New: simple irrigation in the cropland area
- New: water/snow intercepted by canopy as function of vegetation fraction and leaf area index (LAI)

## RUC snow model characteristics:
Snow forms additional two layers on top of soil in RUC LSM
- \b 2-layer \b snow model: when SWE < 1.6 cm - snow layer is combined with top soil layer
- Fractional snow cover (SWE < 3 cm):
- weighted average of snow-covered and snow-free areas to compute snow paramters (roughness, albedo)
- New: "mosaic" approach for patchy snow
  - Seperate treatment of energy and moisture budgets for snow-covered and snow-free portions of the grid cell
  - Aggregate solutions at the end of time step
  - Reduced cold bias for areas with thin snow
\image html ruc_lsm_mosaic.png "Figure 3: recent development: mosaic approach for patchy snow (Courtesy of T.G. Smirnova) " width=10cm
- Iterative snow melting algorithm
- Density of snow on the ground - a function of compaction parameter and snow depth and temperature
- Snow albedo - a function of temperature and snow fraction
- Snow interception by canopy - a function of vegetation fraction and LAI
- Density of falling snow/graupel/ice precipitation  
  - The density of falling snow/graupel/ice is computed inside RUC LSM using empirical temperature-dependent equations;
  - Averaged density of frozen precipitation is defined from weighted contribution of each hydrometeor species:
\f[
 \rho_{fr}=\rho_{sn}*\alpha_{sn}+\rho_{gr}*\alpha_{gr}+\rho_{ice}*\alpha_{ice}
\f]
- The depth of new snow is defined from its liquid equivalent and \f$\rho_{fr}\f$

snow accumulation with variable density is provided as an additional product in the model guidance. Figure 4 shows one example of this product
from the 23-h HRRR forecast for snowstorm on 29 Dec 2015. This product is in the middle panel. The panel on the left uses traditional 10:1 ratio,
and the right panel is oberved snow accumulation. We can see that the new product in the middle here has a better, further north location of maximum
snow accumulation, and high ammounts of snow in the product with 10:1 ratio are trimmed in central and southern Iowa where both observed and model 
precipitation had a high content of sleet. There is even larger improvement in the Chicago area, where observed and model precipitation were almost 
totally sleet.
