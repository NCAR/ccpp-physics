/**
\mainpage Introduction 

Welcome to the scientific documentation for the parameterizations available in the Common 
Community Physics Package (CCPP) v3.0 public release.  

The CCPP-Physics is envisioned to contain parameterizations used by NOAA operational models for weather through
seasonal prediction timescales, as well as developmental schemes under consideration for upcoming 
operational implementations. This version contains all parameterizations of the current operational GFS,
plus additional developmental schemes. The CCPP can currently be used with the Single Column Model (SCM) developed 
by the Global Model Test Bed (GMTB) of the Developmental Testbed Center, as well as with the atmospheric component
of NOAA's Unified Forecast System (UFS-Atmosphere), which employs the the non-hydrostatic 
Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere (FV3) dynamic core.  

In this website you will find documentation on various aspects of each 
parameterization, including a high-level overview of its function, the input/output argument list, 
and a description of the algorithm. 
The latest CCPP public release is Version 3.0 (June 2019), and more details on it may be found on the
<a href="https://dtcenter.org/gmtb/users/ccpp/"> CCPP website </a> hosted by the Global Model Test
Bed (GMTB) of the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC).
