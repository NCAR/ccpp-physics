	Abstract = { Abstract The presence of ice in soil dramatically alters soil hydrologic and thermal properties. Despite this important role, many recent studies show that explicitly including the hydrologic effects of soil ice in land surface models degrades the simulation of runoff in cold regions. This paper addresses this dilemma by employing the Community Land Model version 2.0 (CLM2.0) developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and a simple TOPMODEL-based runoff scheme (SIMTOP). CLM2.0/SIMTOP explicitly computes soil ice content and its modifications to soil hydrologic and thermal properties. However, the frozen soil scheme has a tendency to produce a completely frozen soil (100\% ice content) whenever the soil temperature is below 0$\,^{\circ}$C. The frozen ground prevents infiltration of snowmelt or rainfall, thereby resulting in earlier- and higher-than-observed springtime runoff. This paper presents modifications to the above-mentioned frozen soil scheme that produce more accurate magnitude and seasonality of runoff and soil water storage. These modifications include 1) allowing liquid water to coexist with ice in the soil over a wide range of temperatures below 0$\,^{\circ}$C by using the freezing-point depression equation, 2) computing the vertical water fluxes by introducing the concept of a fractional permeable area, which partitions the model grid into an impermeable part (no vertical water flow) and a permeable part, and 3) using the total soil moisture (liquid water and ice) to calculate the soil matric potential and hydraulic conductivity. The performance of CLM2.0/SIMTOP with these changes has been tested using observed data in cold-region river basins of various spatial scales. Compared to the CLM2.0/SIMTOP frozen soil scheme, the modified scheme produces monthly runoff that compares more favorably with that estimated by the University of New Hampshire--Global Runoff Data Center and a terrestrial water storage change that is in closer agreement with that measured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. },

@article{niu_et_al_2007,
	Abstract = {Groundwater interacts with soil moisture through the exchanges of water between the unsaturated soil and its underlying aquifer under gravity and capillary forces. Despite its importance, groundwater is not explicitly represented in climate models. This paper developed a simple groundwater model (SIMGM) by representing recharge and discharge processes of the water storage in an unconfined aquifer, which is added as a single integration element below the soil of a land surface model. We evaluated the model against the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage change (ΔS) data. The modeled total water storage (including unsaturated soil water and groundwater) change agrees fairly well with GRACE estimates. The anomaly of the modeled groundwater storage explains most of the GRACE ΔS anomaly in most river basins where the water storage is not affected by snow water or frozen soil. For this reason, the anomaly of the modeled water table depth agrees well with that converted from the GRACE ΔS in most of the river basins. We also investigated the impacts of groundwater dynamics on soil moisture and evapotranspiration through the comparison of SIMGM to an additional model run using gravitational free drainage (FD) as the model's lower boundary condition. SIMGM produced much wetter soil profiles globally and up to 16\% more annual evapotranspiration than FD, most obviously in arid-to-wet transition regions.},

	Abstract = {This first paper of the two-part series describes the objectives of the community efforts in improving the Noah land surface model (LSM), documents, through mathematical formulations, the augmented conceptual realism in biophysical and hydrological processes, and introduces a framework for multiple options to parameterize selected processes (Noah-MP). The Noah-MP's performance is evaluated at various local sites using high temporal frequency data sets, and results show the advantages of using multiple optional schemes to interpret the differences in modeling simulations. The second paper focuses on ensemble evaluations with long-term regional (basin) and global scale data sets. The enhanced conceptual realism includes (1) the vegetation canopy energy balance, (2) the layered snowpack, (3) frozen soil and infiltration, (4) soil moisture-groundwater interaction and related runoff production, and (5) vegetation phenology. Sample local-scale validations are conducted over the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) site, the W3 catchment of Sleepers River, Vermont, and a French snow observation site. Noah-MP shows apparent improvements in reproducing surface fluxes, skin temperature over dry periods, snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, and runoff over Noah LSM version 3.0. Noah-MP improves the SWE simulations due to more accurate simulations of the diurnal variations of the snow skin temperature, which is critical for computing available energy for melting. Noah-MP also improves the simulation of runoff peaks and timing by introducing a more permeable frozen soil and more accurate simulation of snowmelt. We also demonstrate that Noah-MP is an effective research tool by which modeling results for a given process can be interpreted through multiple optional parameterization schemes in the same model framework.},

	Abstract = {A closure for the fluxes of mass, heat, and moisture at cloud base in the cumulus-capped boundary layer is developed. The cloud-base mass flux is obtained from a simplifed turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) budget for the sub-cloud layer, in which cumulus convection is assumed to be associated with a transport of TKE from the sub-cloud layer to the cloud layer.The heat and moisture fluxes are obtained from a jump model based on the virtual-potential-temperature equation. A key part of this parametrization is the parametrization of the virtual-temperature flux at the top of the transition zone between the sub-cloud and cloud layers.It is argued that pressure fluctuations must be responsible for the transport of TKE from the cloud layer to the sub-cloud layer.},

It shows that convective updrafts transport a significant amount of momentum vertically. This transport is downgradient in the easterly wind regime, but upgradient during a westerly wind burst. The differences in convective momentum transport between easterly and westerly wind regimes are examined. The perturbation pressure gradient accounts for an important part of the apparent momentum source. In general it is opposite in sign to the product of cloud mass flux and the vertical wind shear, with smaller magnitude. Examination of the dynamic forcing to the pressure field demonstrates that the linear forcing representing the interaction between the convective updrafts and the large-scale wind shear is the dominant term, while the nonlinear forcing is of secondary importance. Thus, parameterization schemes taking into account the linear interaction between the convective updrafts and the large-scale wind shear can capture the essential features of the perturbation pressure field. The parameterization scheme for momentum transport by Zhang and Cho is evaluated using the model simulation data. The parameterized pressure gradient force using the scheme is in excellent agreement with the simulated one. The parameterized apparent momentum source is also in good agreement with the model simulation. Other parameterization methods for the pressure gradient are also discussed.},

@article{bechtold_et_al_2008,
	Abstract = {Advances in simulating atmospheric variability with the ECMWF model are presented that stem from revisions of the convection and diffusion parametrizations. The revisions concern in particular the introduction of a variable convective adjustment time-scale, a convective entrainment rate proportional to the environmental relative humidity, as well as free tropospheric diffusion coefficients for heat and momentum based on Monin--Obukhov functional dependencies.The forecasting system is evaluated against analyses and observations using high-resolution medium-range deterministic and ensemble forecasts, monthly and seasonal integrations, and decadal integrations with coupled atmosphere-ocean models. The results show a significantly higher and more realistic level of model activity in terms of the amplitude of tropical and extratropical mesoscale, synoptic and planetary perturbations. Importantly, with the higher variability and reduced bias not only the probabilistic scores are improved, but also the midlatitude deterministic scores in the short and medium ranges. Furthermore, for the first time the model is able to represent a realistic spectrum of convectively coupled equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves, and maintains a realistic amplitude of the Madden--Julian oscillation (MJO) during monthly forecasts. However, the propagation speed of the MJO is slower than observed. The higher tropical tropospheric wave activity also results in better stratospheric temperatures and winds through the deposition of momentum.The partitioning between convective and resolved precipitation is unaffected by the model changes with roughly 62% of the total global precipitation being of the convective type. Finally, the changes in convection and diffusion parametrizations resulted in a larger spread of the ensemble forecasts, which allowed the amplitude of the initial perturbations in the ensemble prediction system to decrease by 30%.

	Abstract = {A better conceptual understanding and more realistic parameterizations of convective boundary layers in climate and weather prediction models have been major challenges in meteorological research. In particular, parameterizations of the dry convective boundary layer, in spite of the absence of water phase-changes and its consequent simplicity as compared to moist convection, typically suffer from problems in attempting to represent realistically the boundary layer growth and what is often referred to as countergradient fluxes. The eddy-diffusivity (ED) approach has been relatively successful in representing some characteristics of neutral boundary layers and surface layers in general. The mass-flux (MF) approach, on the other hand, has been used for the parameterization of shallow and deep moist convection. In this paper, a new approach that relies on a combination of the ED and MF parameterizations (EDMF) is proposed for the dry convective boundary layer. It is shown that the EDMF approach follows naturally from a decomposition of the turbulent fluxes into 1) a part that includes strong organized updrafts, and 2) a remaining turbulent field. At the basis of the EDMF approach is the concept that nonlocal subgrid transport due to the strong updrafts is taken into account by the MF approach, while the remaining transport is taken into account by an ED closure. Large-eddy simulation (LES) results of the dry convective boundary layer are used to support the theoretical framework of this new approach and to determine the parameters of the EDMF model. The performance of the new formulation is evaluated against LES results, and it is shown that the EDMF closure is able to reproduce the main properties of dry convective boundary layers in a realistic manner. Furthermore, it will be shown that this approach has strong advantages over the more traditional countergradient approach, especially in the entrainment layer. As a result, this EDMF approach opens the way to parameterize the clear and cumulus-topped boundary layer in a simple and unified way.},

@article{soares_et_al_2004,
	Abstract = {Recently, a new consistent way of parametrizing simultaneously local and non-local turbulent transport for the convective atmospheric boundary layer has been proposed and tested for the clear boundary layer. This approach assumes that in the convective boundary layer the subgrid-scale fluxes result from two different mixing scales: small eddies, that are parametrized by an eddy-diffusivity approach, and thermals, which are represented by a mass-flux contribution. Since the interaction between the cloud layer and the underlying sub-cloud layer predominantly takes place through strong updraughts, this approach offers an interesting avenue of establishing a unified description of the turbulent transport in the cumulus-topped boundary layer. This paper explores the possibility of such a new approach for the cumulus-topped boundary layer. In the sub-cloud and cloud layers, the mass-flux term represents the effect of strong updraughts. These are modelled by a simple entraining parcel, which determines the mean properties of the strong updraughts, the boundary-layer height, the lifting condensation level and cloud top. The residual smaller-scale turbulent transport is parametrized with an eddy-diffusivity approach that uses a turbulent kinetic energy closure. The new scheme is implemented and tested in the research model MesoNH. Copyright {\copyright} 2004 Royal Meteorological Society},

	Abstract = {Abstract In a recent paper, Kuo and Schubert demonstrated the lack of observational support for the relevance of the criterion for cloud-top entrainment instability proposed by Randall and by Deardorff. Here we derive a new criterion, based on a model of the instability as resulting from the energy released close to cloud top, by Mixing between saturated boundary-layer air and unsaturated air from above the capping inversion. The condition is derived by considering the net conversion from potential to kinetic energy in a system consisting of two layers of fluid straddling cloud-top, when a small amount of mixing occurs between these layers. This contrasts with previous analyses, which only considered the change in buoyancy of the cloud layer when unsaturated air is mixed into it. In its most general form, this new criterion depends on the ratio of the depths of the layers involved in the mixing. It is argued that, for a self-sustaining instability, there must be a net release of kinetic energy on the same depth and time scales as the entrainment process itself. There are two plausible ways in which this requirement may be satisfied. Either one takes the depths of the layers involved in the mixing to each be comparable to the vertical scale of the entrainment process, which is typically of order tens of meters or less, or alternatively, one must allow for the efficiency with which energy released by mixing through a much deeper lower layer becomes available to initiate further entrainment. In both cases the same criterion for instability results. This criterion is much more restrictive than that proposed by Randall and by Deardorff; furthermore, the observational data is then consistent with the predictions of the current theory. Further analysis provides estimates of the turbulent fluxes associated with cloud-top entrainment instability. This analysis effectively constitutes an energetically consistent turbulence closure for models of boundary layers with cloud. The implications for such numerical models are discussed. Comparisons are also made with other possible criteria for cloud-top entrainment instability which have recently been suggested.},

A boundary layer diffusion package based on the Troen and Mahrt nonlocal diffusion concept has been tested for possible operational implementation. The results from this approach are compared with those from the local diffusion approach, which is the current operational scheme, and verified against FIFE observations during 9?10 August 1987. The comparisons between local and nonlocal approaches are extended to the forecast for a heavy rain case of 15?17 May 1995. The sensitivity of both the boundary layer development and the precipitation forecast to the tuning parameters in the nonlocal diffusion scheme is also investigated. Special attention is given to the interaction of boundary layer processes with precipitation physics. Some results of parallel runs during August 1995 are also presented.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A parameterization of the convection-induced pressure gradient force (PGF) in convective momentum transport (CMT) is tested for hurricane intensity forecasting using NCEP's operational Global Forecast System (GFS) and its nested Regional Spectral Model (RSM). In the parameterization the PGF is assumed to be proportional to the product of the cloud mass flux and vertical wind shear. Compared to control forecasts using the present operational GFS and RSM where the PGF effect in CMT is taken into account empirically, the new PGF parameterization helps increase hurricane intensity by reducing the vertical momentum exchange, giving rise to a closer comparison to the observations. In addition, the new PGF parameterization forecasts not only show more realistically organized precipitation patterns with enhanced hurricane intensity but also reduce the forecast track error. Nevertheless, the model forecasts with the new PGF parameterization still largely underpredict the observed intensity. One of the many possible reasons for the large underprediction may be the absence of hurricane initialization in the models.},
