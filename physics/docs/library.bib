	Abstract = {A closure for the fluxes of mass, heat, and moisture at cloud base in the cumulus-capped boundary layer is developed. The cloud-base mass flux is obtained from a simplifed turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) budget for the sub-cloud layer, in which cumulus convection is assumed to be associated with a transport of TKE from the sub-cloud layer to the cloud layer.The heat and moisture fluxes are obtained from a jump model based on the virtual-potential-temperature equation. A key part of this parametrization is the parametrization of the virtual-temperature flux at the top of the transition zone between the sub-cloud and cloud layers.It is argued that pressure fluctuations must be responsible for the transport of TKE from the cloud layer to the sub-cloud layer.},

@article{bechtold_et_al_2008,
	Abstract = {Advances in simulating atmospheric variability with the ECMWF model are presented that stem from revisions of the convection and diffusion parametrizations. The revisions concern in particular the introduction of a variable convective adjustment time-scale, a convective entrainment rate proportional to the environmental relative humidity, as well as free tropospheric diffusion coefficients for heat and momentum based on Monin--Obukhov functional dependencies.The forecasting system is evaluated against analyses and observations using high-resolution medium-range deterministic and ensemble forecasts, monthly and seasonal integrations, and decadal integrations with coupled atmosphere-ocean models. The results show a significantly higher and more realistic level of model activity in terms of the amplitude of tropical and extratropical mesoscale, synoptic and planetary perturbations. Importantly, with the higher variability and reduced bias not only the probabilistic scores are improved, but also the midlatitude deterministic scores in the short and medium ranges. Furthermore, for the first time the model is able to represent a realistic spectrum of convectively coupled equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves, and maintains a realistic amplitude of the Madden--Julian oscillation (MJO) during monthly forecasts. However, the propagation speed of the MJO is slower than observed. The higher tropical tropospheric wave activity also results in better stratospheric temperatures and winds through the deposition of momentum.The partitioning between convective and resolved precipitation is unaffected by the model changes with roughly 62% of the total global precipitation being of the convective type. Finally, the changes in convection and diffusion parametrizations resulted in a larger spread of the ensemble forecasts, which allowed the amplitude of the initial perturbations in the ensemble prediction system to decrease by 30%.

	Abstract = {A better conceptual understanding and more realistic parameterizations of convective boundary layers in climate and weather prediction models have been major challenges in meteorological research. In particular, parameterizations of the dry convective boundary layer, in spite of the absence of water phase-changes and its consequent simplicity as compared to moist convection, typically suffer from problems in attempting to represent realistically the boundary layer growth and what is often referred to as countergradient fluxes. The eddy-diffusivity (ED) approach has been relatively successful in representing some characteristics of neutral boundary layers and surface layers in general. The mass-flux (MF) approach, on the other hand, has been used for the parameterization of shallow and deep moist convection. In this paper, a new approach that relies on a combination of the ED and MF parameterizations (EDMF) is proposed for the dry convective boundary layer. It is shown that the EDMF approach follows naturally from a decomposition of the turbulent fluxes into 1) a part that includes strong organized updrafts, and 2) a remaining turbulent field. At the basis of the EDMF approach is the concept that nonlocal subgrid transport due to the strong updrafts is taken into account by the MF approach, while the remaining transport is taken into account by an ED closure. Large-eddy simulation (LES) results of the dry convective boundary layer are used to support the theoretical framework of this new approach and to determine the parameters of the EDMF model. The performance of the new formulation is evaluated against LES results, and it is shown that the EDMF closure is able to reproduce the main properties of dry convective boundary layers in a realistic manner. Furthermore, it will be shown that this approach has strong advantages over the more traditional countergradient approach, especially in the entrainment layer. As a result, this EDMF approach opens the way to parameterize the clear and cumulus-topped boundary layer in a simple and unified way.},

	Abstract = {Recently, a new consistent way of parametrizing simultaneously local and non-local turbulent transport for the convective atmospheric boundary layer has been proposed and tested for the clear boundary layer. This approach assumes that in the convective boundary layer the subgrid-scale fluxes result from two different mixing scales: small eddies, that are parametrized by an eddy-diffusivity approach, and thermals, which are represented by a mass-flux contribution. Since the interaction between the cloud layer and the underlying sub-cloud layer predominantly takes place through strong updraughts, this approach offers an interesting avenue of establishing a unified description of the turbulent transport in the cumulus-topped boundary layer. This paper explores the possibility of such a new approach for the cumulus-topped boundary layer. In the sub-cloud and cloud layers, the mass-flux term represents the effect of strong updraughts. These are modelled by a simple entraining parcel, which determines the mean properties of the strong updraughts, the boundary-layer height, the lifting condensation level and cloud top. The residual smaller-scale turbulent transport is parametrized with an eddy-diffusivity approach that uses a turbulent kinetic energy closure. The new scheme is implemented and tested in the research model MesoNH. Copyright {\copyright} 2004 Royal Meteorological Society},

	Abstract = {Abstract In a recent paper, Kuo and Schubert demonstrated the lack of observational support for the relevance of the criterion for cloud-top entrainment instability proposed by Randall and by Deardorff. Here we derive a new criterion, based on a model of the instability as resulting from the energy released close to cloud top, by Mixing between saturated boundary-layer air and unsaturated air from above the capping inversion. The condition is derived by considering the net conversion from potential to kinetic energy in a system consisting of two layers of fluid straddling cloud-top, when a small amount of mixing occurs between these layers. This contrasts with previous analyses, which only considered the change in buoyancy of the cloud layer when unsaturated air is mixed into it. In its most general form, this new criterion depends on the ratio of the depths of the layers involved in the mixing. It is argued that, for a self-sustaining instability, there must be a net release of kinetic energy on the same depth and time scales as the entrainment process itself. There are two plausible ways in which this requirement may be satisfied. Either one takes the depths of the layers involved in the mixing to each be comparable to the vertical scale of the entrainment process, which is typically of order tens of meters or less, or alternatively, one must allow for the efficiency with which energy released by mixing through a much deeper lower layer becomes available to initiate further entrainment. In both cases the same criterion for instability results. This criterion is much more restrictive than that proposed by Randall and by Deardorff; furthermore, the observational data is then consistent with the predictions of the current theory. Further analysis provides estimates of the turbulent fluxes associated with cloud-top entrainment instability. This analysis effectively constitutes an energetically consistent turbulence closure for models of boundary layers with cloud. The implications for such numerical models are discussed. Comparisons are also made with other possible criteria for cloud-top entrainment instability which have recently been suggested.},

A boundary layer diffusion package based on the Troen and Mahrt nonlocal diffusion concept has been tested for possible operational implementation. The results from this approach are compared with those from the local diffusion approach, which is the current operational scheme, and verified against FIFE observations during 9?10 August 1987. The comparisons between local and nonlocal approaches are extended to the forecast for a heavy rain case of 15?17 May 1995. The sensitivity of both the boundary layer development and the precipitation forecast to the tuning parameters in the nonlocal diffusion scheme is also investigated. Special attention is given to the interaction of boundary layer processes with precipitation physics. Some results of parallel runs during August 1995 are also presented.},

	Abstract = {AbstractThe current operational eddy-diffusivity counter-gradient (EDCG) planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme in the NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) tends to underestimate the PBL growth in the convective boundary layer (CBL). To improve CBL growth, an eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) PBL scheme is developed, where the nonlocal transport by large turbulent eddies is represented by a mass-flux (MF) scheme and the local transport by small eddies is represented by an eddy-diffusivity (ED) scheme. For the vertical momentum mixing, the MF scheme is modified to include the effect of the updraft-induced pressure gradient force.While the EDMF scheme displays better CBL growth than the EDCG scheme, it tends to overproduce the amount of low clouds and degrades wind vector forecasts over the tropical ocean where strongly unstable PBLs are rarely found. In order not to degrade the forecast skill in the tropics, a hybrid scheme is developed, where the EDMF scheme is applied only for the strongly unstable PBL, while the EDCG scheme is used for the weakly unstable PBL. Along with the hybrid EDMF scheme, the heating by turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation is parameterized to reduce an energy imbalance in the GFS. To enhance a too weak vertical turbulent mixing for weakly and moderately stable conditions, the current local scheme in the stable boundary layer (SBL) is modified to use an ED profile method. The hybrid EDMF PBL scheme with TKE dissipative heating and modified SBL mixing led to significant improvements in some key medium-range weather forecast metrics and was operationally implemented into the NCEP GFS in January 2015.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A parameterization of the convection-induced pressure gradient force (PGF) in convective momentum transport (CMT) is tested for hurricane intensity forecasting using NCEP's operational Global Forecast System (GFS) and its nested Regional Spectral Model (RSM). In the parameterization the PGF is assumed to be proportional to the product of the cloud mass flux and vertical wind shear. Compared to control forecasts using the present operational GFS and RSM where the PGF effect in CMT is taken into account empirically, the new PGF parameterization helps increase hurricane intensity by reducing the vertical momentum exchange, giving rise to a closer comparison to the observations. In addition, the new PGF parameterization forecasts not only show more realistically organized precipitation patterns with enhanced hurricane intensity but also reduce the forecast track error. Nevertheless, the model forecasts with the new PGF parameterization still largely underpredict the observed intensity. One of the many possible reasons for the large underprediction may be the absence of hurricane initialization in the models.},
